Circular RNA phosphorylase kinase regulatory subunit alpha 2 (circPHKA2; hsa_circ_0090002) has a significantly, specifically different expression in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients' blood. Here, we intended to investigate the role and mechanism of circPHKA2 in oxygen-glucose deprivation- (OGD-) induced stoke model in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Methods. Expression of circPHKA2, microRNA- (miR-) 574-5p, and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) was detected by quantitative PCR and western blotting. Cell injury was measured by detecting cell proliferation (EdU assay and CCK-8 assay), migration (transwell assay), neovascularization (tube formation assay), apoptosis (flow cytometry and western blotting), endoplasmic reticulum stress (western blotting), and oxidative stress (assay kits). Direct intermolecular interaction was determined by bioinformatics algorithms, dual-luciferase reporter assay, biotin-labelled miRNA capture, and argonaute 2 RNA immunoprecipitation. Results. circPHKA2 was downregulated in AIS patients' blood in SOD2-correlated manner. Reexpressing circPHKA2 rescued EdU incorporation, cell viability and migration, tube formation, B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) expression, and SOD activity of OGD-induced HBMEC and alleviate apoptotic rate and levels of Bcl-2-associated protein (Bax), glucose-regulated protein 78 kD (GRP78), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-12, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Additionally, blocking SOD2 partially attenuated these roles of circPHKA2 overexpression. Molecularly, circPHKA2 upregulated SOD2 expression via interacting with miR-574-5p, and miR-574-5p could target SOD2. Similarly, allied to neurovascular protection of circPHKA2 was the downregulation of miR-574-5p. Conclusion. circPHKA2 could protect HBMEC against OGD-induced cerebral stroke model via the miR-574-5p/SOD2 axis, suggesting circPHKA2 as a novel and promising candidate in ischemic brain injury. © 2021 Xiaobo Yang et al.","","Blood;

Studies prove that circRNAs perform critical roles in various biological processes, and the aberrant expression of circRNAs is closely related to tumorigenesis. Therefore, identifying potential circRNA-disease associations is beneficial to understand the pathogenesis of complex diseases at the circRNA level and helps biomedical researchers and practitioners to discover diagnostic biomarkers accurately. However, it is tremendously laborious and time-consuming to discover disease-related circRNAs with conventional biological experiments. In this study, we develop an integrative framework, called iCDA-CMG, to predict potential associations between circRNAs and diseases. By incorporating multi-source prior knowledge, including known circRNA-disease associations, disease similarities and circRNA similarities, we adopt a collective matrix completion-based graph learning model to prioritize the most promising disease-related circRNAs for guiding laborious clinical trials. The results show that iCDA-CMG outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of cross-validation and independent prediction. Moreover, the case studies for several representative cancers suggest the effectiveness of iCDA-CMG in screening circRNA candidates for human diseases, which will contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis mechanisms and unveiling new opportunities for disease diagnosis and targeted therapy. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","circRNA–disease associations; Circular RNA (circRNA); Disease circRNA prediction; Multi-similarity fusion","Algorithms; Computational Biology; Datasets as Topic; Humans; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Neoplasms; Research Design; RNA, Circular; RNA, Neoplasm; biological marker; circular ribonucleic acid; microRNA; RNA; Article; benchmarking; case study; comparative study; data base; directed acyclic graph; disease association; genetic screening; genetic similarity; human; k nearest neighbor; malignant neoplasm; pathogenesis; physician; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; singular value decomposition; algorithm; biological model; biology; classification; genetics; information processing; metabolism; methodology; neoplasm; pathology; procedures; statistical model","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, Circular, ; RNA, Neoplasm, ","","","Scientific Research Foundation of Hunan Provincial Education Department, (20B348); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62002116); Hunan Normal University; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2020JJ5373); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (2018RS3065, 2018TP1018)","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the members of Yide Yang’s group (School of Medicine, Hunan Normal University) for helpful discussions and valuable comments.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62002116), the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (2020JJ5373), the Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department (No.20B348), and the Hunan Provincial Science & Technology Project Foundation (2018TP1018, 2018RS3065).

However, the effective diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches to treat bacterial infections are still limited. As a group of non-coding RNA, circular RNAs (circRNAs) that were expressed specifically in host cells and played a key regulatory role have the potential to be of diagnostic and therapeutic values. In this review, we systematically summarize the role of circRNAs in common bacterial infections and their potential roles as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial infections; Circular RNAs; Diagnosis; Treatment","Bacterial Infections; Humans; RNA, Circular; circular ribonucleic acid; circular ribonucleic acid; Bacterial infections; Circular RNA; Diagnostic markers; Diagnostic methods; Diagnostic value; Economic stability; Host cells; Therapeutic targets; Therapeutic values; Treatment; bacterial infection; disease exacerbation; disease severity; gonorrhea; Helicobacter infection; hemolytic Streptococcus infection; human; immune response; nonhuman; Pseudomonas infection; Review; RNA sequence; signal transduction; Staphylococcus aureus infection; tuberculosis; genetics; Diagnosis","","RNA, Circular, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81973105, 82273696)","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82273696 and No. 81973105 ).

It regulates disease development by modulating the expression of disease-related genes. Therefore, exploring the circRNA-disease relationship can reveal the molecular mechanism of disease pathogenesis. Biological experiments for detecting circRNA-disease associations are time-consuming and laborious. Constrained by the sparsity of known circRNA-disease associations, existing algorithms cannot obtain relatively complete structural information to represent features accurately. To this end, this paper proposes a new predictor, VGAERF, combining Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) and Random Forest (RF). Firstly, circRNA homogeneous graph structure and disease homogeneous graph structure are constructed by Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernel similarity, semantic similarity, and known circRNA-disease associations. VGAEs with the same structure are employed to extract the higher-order features by the encoding and decoding of input graph structures. To further increase the completeness of the network structure information, the deep features acquired from the two VGAEs are summed, and then train the RF with sparse data processing capability to perform the prediction task. On the independent test set, the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC), accuracy, and Area Under PR Curve (AUPR) of the proposed method reach up to 0.9803, 0.9345, and 0.9894, respectively. On the same dataset, the AUC, accuracy, and AUPR of VGAERF are 2.09%, 5.93%, and 1.86% higher than the best-performing method (AEDNN). It is anticipated that VGAERF will provide significant information to decipher the molecular mechanisms of circRNA-disease associations, and promote the diagnosis of circRNA-related diseases. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","CircRNA-disease association; Graph neural network; Random forest; Variational graph auto-encoder","Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Female; Humans; Labor, Obstetric; Pregnancy; RNA, Circular; Semantics; Association reactions; Data handling; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Graph neural networks; Graphic methods; Network coding; Random forests; Semantics; circular ribonucleic acid; Auto encoders; CircRNA-disease association; Disease associations; Graph neural networks; Graph structures; Molecular mechanism; Random forests; RNA molecules; ROC curves; Variational graph auto-encoder; area under the curve; Article; autoencoder; controlled study; data processing; disease association; diseases; feature extraction; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; algorithm; female; genetics; human; labor; pregnancy; semantics; RNA","","RNA, Circular, ","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2020QF037)","This research is supported by Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China under grant number ZR2020QF037 .","Liu Z., Yang Y., Yang Z., Xia S., Lin D., Xiao B., Xiu Y., Novel circRNA_0071196/miRNA19b3p/CIT axis is associated with proliferation and migration of bladder cancer, Int.

With the development of technology, the associations between circRNA and diseases have been discovered, and these associations will help diagnose and treat diseases. However, it is time-consuming and costly to detect the associations between circRNAs and diseases with the experimental methods. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a feasible and effective computational method for predicting circRNA-disease associations. In this paper, we propose a new computational framework called VLCDA to identify the potential circRNA-disease associations. Initially, we construct features by fusing circRNA expression profile features and circRNA protein-coding ability features, disease semantic features, circRNA and disease GIP Kernel features, and use VGAE to mine its deep latent features. Finally, we use the fusion features to train the LightGBM classifier and the trained LightGBM to identify the circRNA-disease associations. The main contribution of VLCDA is that we firstly add circRNA protein-coding ability feature to the circRNA-disease association prediction model. In addition, VLCDA uses variational graph auto-encoders to extract the latent features of circRNA-disease associations to improve the prediction model's accuracy further. VLCDA obtained the area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores of 0.9783 in 5-fold cross-validation.

Previous experimental and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture has a positive effect for CAG. Apoptosis of gastric mucosal tissue has been shown to play an important role in the process of gastric atrophy and possibly further carcinogenesis in CAG, and the circular RNA (circRNA), a novel class of non-coding RNA, has been confirmed to play a regulatory role in the downstream pathway of apoptosis by many stu-dies. Accumulated findings of experimental studies showed that acupuncture and moxibustion interventions could suppress apoptosis of the cultured human gastric mucosal epithelial cells and lower apoptotic index of gastric mucosal cells in CAG rats. Therefore, circRNA is likely to mediate the inhibitory effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on apoptosis of gastric mucosal epithelial cells in CAG. In this paper, we systematically summarized 1) the regulation of circRNA on apoptosis, 2) the apoptosis and pathological mechanism of CAG, 3) the effect of acupuncture on apoptosis, and proposed that circRNA is highly likely to be involved in the positive effect of acupuncture and moxibustion interventions for CAG. It is recommended that researches should further reveal the scientific basis of acupuncture and moxibustion therapies in the treatment of CAG by exploring the role of related circRNAs and their downstream target proteins in the gastric mucosal tissues.","Acupuncture-moxibustion; Apoptosis; Chronic atrophic gastritis; Circular RNA; Gastric mucosal tissue","Animals; Apoptosis; Gastric Mucosa; Gastritis, Atrophic; Moxibustion; Rats; Research Design; RNA, Circular; animal; apoptosis; atrophic gastritis; methodology; moxibustion; rat; stomach mucosa","","RNA, Circular, ","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","10000607","","","32869581","Chinese","Zhen Ci Yan Jiu","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090107850"

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, United States","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs featuring a covalently closed ring structure formed through backsplicing. circRNAs are broadly expressed and contribute to biological processes through a variety of functions. Standard gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches to study gene functions have significant limitations when studying circRNAs. Overexpression studies in particular suffer from the lack of efficient genetic tools. While mammalian expression plasmids enable transient circRNA overexpression in cultured cells, most cell biological studies require long-term ectopic expression. Here we report the development and characterization of genetic tools enabling stable circRNA overexpression in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that circRNA expression constructs can be delivered to cultured cells via transposons, whereas lentiviral vectors have limited utility for the delivery of circRNA constructs due to viral RNA splicing in virus-producing cells. We further demonstrated ectopic circRNA expression in a hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model upon circRNA transposon delivery via hydrodynamic tail vein injection. Furthermore, we generated genetically engineered mice harbouring circRNA expression constructs. We demonstrated that this approach enables constitutive, global circRNA overexpression as well as inducible circRNA expression directed specifically to melanocytes in a melanoma mouse model. These tools expand the genetic toolkit available for the functional characterization of circRNAs. © 2022 The Author(s).

Genetic variation of circRNAs may affect complex traits/diseases by changing their binding efficiency to target miRNAs and proteins. There is a growing demand for investigations of the functions of genetic changes using large-scale experimental evidence. However, there is no online genetic resource for circRNA genes. Results: We performed extensive genetic annotation of 295,526 circRNAs integrated from circBase, circNet and circRNAdb. All pre-computed genetic variants were presented at our online resource, circVAR, with data browsing and search functionality. We explored the chromosome-based distribution of circRNAs and their associated variants. We found that, based on mapping to the 1000 Genomes and ClinVAR databases, chromosome 17 has a relatively large number of circRNAs and associated common and health-related genetic variants. Following the annotation of genome wide association studies (GWAS)-based circRNA variants, we found many non-coding variants within circRNAs, suggesting novel mechanisms for common diseases reported from GWAS studies. For cancer-based somatic variants, we found that chromosome 7 has many highly complex mutations that have been overlooked in previous research. Conclusion: We used the circVAR database to collect SNPs and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) in putative circRNA regions and to identify their potential phenotypic information. To provide a reusable resource for the circRNA research community, we have published all the pre-computed genetic data concerning circRNAs and associated genes together with data query and browsing functions at http://soft.bioinfo-minzhao.org/circvar. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bioinformatics database; Circular RNA; Genetic variant; Systems biology","Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; MicroRNAs; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Proteins; RNA; RNA, Circular; circular ribonucleic acid; microRNA; protein; RNA; Article; bioinformatics; cancer genetics; chromosome 17; chromosome 7; circVAR database; genetic database; genetic resource; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; human; human genome; indel mutation; phenotype; somatic mutation; systems biology; genetics; molecular genetics","","protein, 67254-75-5; RNA, 63231-63-0; MicroRNAs, ; Proteins, ; RNA, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31671375); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFC1201200)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 31671375), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFC1201200) and the research start-up fellowship of the University of the Sunshine Coast to M.Z.

The precise etiology and molecular mechanisms underlying POCD remain uncovered. These reasons led us to employ integrative bioinformatics and machine learning methodologies to identify several biological signaling pathways involved and molecular signatures to better understand the pathophysiology of POCD. A total of 223 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) comprising 156 upregulated and 67 downregulated genes were identified from the circRNA microarray dataset by comparing POCD and non-POCD samples. Gene ontology (GO) analyses of DEGs were significantly involved in neurogenesis, autophagy regulation, translation in the postsynapse, modulating synaptic transmission, regulation of the cellular catabolic process, macromolecule modification, and chromatin remodeling. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated some key molecular pathways, including mTOR signaling pathway, AKT phosphorylation of cytosolic targets, MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, nitric oxide signaling pathway, chaperones that modulate interferon signaling pathway, apoptosis signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, cellular senescence, RANKL/RARK signaling pathway, and AGE/RAGE pathway. Furthermore, seven hub genes were identified from the PPI network and also determined transcription factors and protein kinases. Finally, we identified a new predictive drug for the treatment of SCZ using the LINCS L1000, GCP, and P100 databases. Together, our results bring a new era of the pathogenesis of a deeper understanding of POCD, identified novel therapeutic targets, and predicted drug inhibitors in POCD. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bioinformatics methods;

Internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) were reported to drive translation of circRNAs. Experimental methods confirming the presence of IRES and m6A site are time consuming and labor intensive. Lacking computational tools to predict ORFs, IRESs and m6A sites for circRNAs makes it harder. Results: In this report, we present circPrimer 2.0, a Java based software for annotating circRNAs and predicting ORFs, IRESs, and m6A sites of circRNAs. circPrimer 2.0 has a graphical and a command-line interface that enables the tool to be embed into an analysis pipeline.

The majority of mTLE patients develop pharmacoresistance to available anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) while exhibiting severe pathological changes that can include hippocampal atrophy, neuronal death, gliosis and chronic seizures. The molecular mechanisms leading to mTLE remain incompletely understood, but are known to include defects in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, including in non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of recently rediscovered ncRNAs with high levels of expression in the brain and proposed roles in diverse neuronal processes. To explore a potential role for circRNAs in epilepsy, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on hippocampal tissue from a rat perforant pathway stimulation (PPS) model of TLE at different post-stimulation time points. This analysis revealed 218 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs. Remarkably, the majority of these circRNAs were changed at the time of the occurrence of the first spontaneous seizure (DOFS). The expression pattern of two circRNAs, circ_Arhgap4 and circ_Nav3, was further validated and linked to miR-6328 and miR-10b-3p target regulation, respectively. This is the first study to examine the regulation of circRNAs during the development of epilepsy. It reveals an intriguing link between circRNA deregulation and the transition of brain networks into the state of spontaneous seizure activity. Together, our results provide a molecular framework for further understanding the role and mechanism-of-action of circRNAs in TLE. © Copyright © 2021 Gomes-Duarte, Bauer, Venø, Norwood, Henshall, Kjems, Rosenow, Vangoor and Pasterkamp.","circular RNA; early epilepsy; epileptogenesis; microRNA; network analysis; RNA-sequencing; temporal lobe epilepsy","beta actin; buffer; circular ribonucleic acid; DNA polymerase; micro rna 10b 3p; micro rna 6328; neurotrophin; transcriptome; unclassified drug; 3' untranslated region; adult; agar gel electrophoresis; algorithm; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bioinformatics; controlled study; dentate gyrus; deregulation; gene expression; gene ontology; gliosis; hippocampus; learning; male; microarray analysis; morphogenesis; Mus musculus; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; network analysis; nonhuman; perfusion; protein expression; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; seizure; signal transduction; spatiotemporal analysis; synaptogenesis; temporal lobe epilepsy; upregulation","","DNA polymerase, 37217-33-7","","","Marie Skłodowska-Curie; Nefeli Kakava and Mieneke Luijendijk; Seventh Framework?; Seventh Framework” Program (FP7; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (721890); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (602130, WAR18-05); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (16/RC/3948); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the European Union’s “Seventh Framework” Program (FP7) under Grant Agreement 602130 (EpimiRNA), the Epilepsiefonds (WAR18-05), Science Foundation Ireland under Grant Number 16/RC/3948 and co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund and by FutureNeuro industry partners (DCH), and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 721890 (circRTrain ITN).; Funding text 2: We thank Nefeli Kakava and Mieneke Luijendijk for providing P1 Long Evans rats.

Owing to their stable structures, sequence conservations, and cell- or tissue-specific expressions, these RNA have become a popular subject of scientific research. With the development of sequencing methods, it has been revealed that circRNAs exert their biological function by sponging microRNAs (miRNAs), regulating transcription, or binding to proteins. Humans have historically been significantly impacted by various types of cancer. Studies have shown that circRNAs are abnormally expressed in various cancers and are involved in the occurrence and development of malignant tumors, such as tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. As one of its star molecules, circ_0007534 is upregulated in colorectal, cervical, and pancreatic cancers; is closely related to the occurrence, development, and prognosis of tumors; and is expected to become a novel tumor marker and therapeutic target. This article briefly reviews the expression and mechanism of circ_0007534 in malignant tumors based on the domestic and foreign literature.

We researched clinical significance of circPVT1 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received cisplatin combined with gemcitabine chemotherapy. Methods: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect circPVT1 expression in 96 patients with NSCLC. In addition, Kaplan-Meier methods were performed to analyze survival of patients with NSCLC. Results: There is no significant difference between circPVT1 and age, sex, histologic type, lymphatic invasion, or vascular invasion in patients with NSCLC and there is significant difference between circPVT1 and differentiation or p-TNM stage in patients with NSCLC. In addition, after cisplatin combined with gemcitabine chemotherapy, circPVT1 expression was decreased, and circPVT1 expression in the chemotherapy-resistant group was higher than in the chemotherapy-sensitive group. Survival of patients with NSCLC was associated with high circPVT1 expression. Conclusions: Our study revealed the clinical significance of circPVT1 in NSCLC after cisplatin combined with gemcitabine chemotherapy. After treatment, circPVT1 expression was decreased and circPVT1 expression in chemotherapy-resistant patients was higher than in chemotherapy-sensitive patients. Decreased circPVT1 expression in chemotherapy-sensitive patients is more notable than in chemotherapy-resistant patients. Therefore, it is possible to determine the effect of therapy after receiving chemotherapy by detecting the expression of circRNA in serum. © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.","CircPVT1;

However, a precise function and working mechanism are lacking for the larger majority. Following many different experimental and computational approaches to identify circRNAs, multiple circRNA databases were developed as well. Unfortunately, there are several major issues with the current circRNA databases, which substantially hamper progression in the field. First, as the overlap in content is limited, a true reference set of circRNAs is lacking. This results from the low abundance and highly specific expression of circRNAs, and varying sequencing methods, data-analysis pipelines, and circRNA detection tools. A second major issue is the use of ambiguous nomenclature. Thus, redundant or even conflicting names for circRNAs across different databases contribute to the reproducibility crisis. Third, circRNA databases, in essence, rely on the position of the circRNA back-splice junction, whereas alternative splicing could result in circRNAs with different length and sequence. To uniquely identify a circRNA molecule, the full circular sequence is required. Fourth, circRNA databases annotate circRNAs' microRNA binding and protein-coding potential, but these annotations are generally based on presumed circRNA sequences. Finally, several databases are not regularly updated, contain incomplete data or suffer from connectivity issues. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current circRNA databases and their content, features, and usability. In addition to discussing the current issues regarding circRNA databases, we come with important suggestions to streamline further research in this growing field.  © 2020 The Author(s).

They play important regulatory role in diseases through interactions of miRNAs associated with the diseases. Due to their insensitivity to nucleases, they are more stable than linear RNAs. It is thus imperative to integrate available information for predicting circRNA-disease associations in humans. Here, we propose a computational model to predict circRNA-disease associations based on accelerated attributed network embedding (AANE) algorithm and autoencoder(AE). First, we use AANE algorithm to extract low-dimensional features of circRNAs and diseases and then stacked autoencoder (SAE) to automatically extract in-depth features. The features obtained by AANE and the SAE are integrated and XGBoost is used as a binary classifier to get the predicted results. The proposed model has an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.8800 in 5-fold cross validation and 0.8988 in 10-fold cross validation. The factors that can affect the performance of the model are discussed and some common diseases are used as case studies. Results indicated that the model has great performance in predicting circRNA-disease associations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Autoencoder; circRNA; Disease; Graph embedding; XGBoost","Embeddings; Forecasting; Autoencoders; Circrna; Computational model; Disease associations; Embedding algorithms; Graph embeddings; Low dimensional; Network embedding; Performance; Xgboost; RNA","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61902230, 61972451); Shaanxi Normal University, (GK201901010); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61972451, 61902230) and the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities, Shaanxi Normal University (No. GK201901010).

Subsequent discoveries have shown that lncRNAs participate in a wide range of molecular processes, controlling gene expression and protein activity though direct interactions with proteins, DNA or other RNA molecules. Although significant advances have been achieved in the understanding of lncRNA biology in the animal kingdom, the functional characterization of plant lncRNAs is still in its infancy and remains a major challenge. In this review, we report emerging functional and mechanistic paradigms of plant lncRNAs and partner molecules, and discuss how cutting-edge technologies may help to identify and classify yet uncharacterized transcripts into functional groups. © 2020 The Authors New Phytologist © 2020 New Phytologist Trust","alternative splicing; antisense transcripts; circular RNAs; genome topology; plant long noncoding RNAs; RNA-related methodologies; transcription; transcriptional read-through","Animals; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Plants; RNA, Long Noncoding; Eukaryota; long untranslated RNA; classification; functional change; molecular analysis; plant; RNA; animal; genetics; high throughput sequencing; plant","","RNA, Long Noncoding, ","","","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCyT","We thank New Phytologist for the invitation to contribute with this article.

Emerging evidence has confirmed that circRNAs take part in many biological processes in a variety of malignant tumors, including gliomas, suggesting that they could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for tumors. The purpose of this study was to explore the roles of circRNAs in gliomas and to provide valuable clues for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods: RNA-seq data with poly(A)-/RNase R treatment was employed to investigate the expression profiles of circRNAs in tumor and paracancerous tissues derived from glioma patients. CircAST was used for full-length circRNA reconstruction and quantification. Bioinformatics analyses, including GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses, were performed to reveal the potential biological process and pathways of their host genes. A circRNA-miRNA interaction network was constructed to depict the interactions of the dysregulated circRNA transcripts with miRNAs. Results: A total of 20,474 circular transcripts that originated from 16,022 circRNAs were successfully reconstructed in the samples. We detected 646 upregulated and 112 downregulated circular transcripts in tumor tissues compared with paracancerous tissues. GO analysis revealed that their host genes might be related to positive regulation of GTPase activity, regulation of synaptic transmission, and glutama-tergic and dendrite morphogenesis in the cytoplasm and cytosol. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the glutamatergic synapse, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and ErbB signaling pathway might be linked to the occurrence and development of gliomas. Conclusion: Our study revealed a comprehensive profile of differentially expressed circRNA transcripts in gliomas, indicating that aberrantly expressed circRNAs might play important roles in the occurrence and development of human gliomas. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","CircRNA;

A increasing number of experimental studies have shown that circRNA plays an important role in the development of diseases, and circRNA biomarkers are helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of various human diseases. There is a pressing demand to establish an effective computational method to identify the associations between circRNAs and diseases. In this paper, we propose a new computational framework for the prediction of the circRNA-disease associations. In particular, we calculated meta path-based feature vectors for each circRNAdisease pair on a heterogeneous information network (HIN) that integrated multiple subnetworks, including circRNA similarity network, disease similarity network, protein similarity network, circRNA-disease associations, circRNA-protein associations and protein-disease associations. A positive-unlabeled learning algorithm was adopted to generate negative samples, and a random forest classifier was trained to predicted circRNA-disease associations. We conducted performance comparison with three popular methods on the CircR2Disease dataset.

One of them, discovered relatively recently, is circular RNA - covalently closed circles (circRNA). In recent years, there has been a huge increase in the interest of researchers in this group of molecules. It entailed a significant increase in the state of knowledge about them, which in turn caused a dramatic change in their perception. Rather than seeing circular RNAs as curiosities that represent a minor information noise in a cell or a result of RNA misprocessing, they came to be regarded as a common, essential, and potentially extremely useful group of molecules. Nevertheless, the current state of the art of circRNA is full of white cards. A lot of valuable information has been obtained from high-throughput methods to study whole transcriptomes, but many issues related to circular RNAs still need to be clarified. Presumably, each answer obtained will raise several new questions. However, circRNAs have a wealth of potential applications, including therapeutic applications. © 2023","Biomarkers; cancer; circRNA; Delivery systems; Non-coding RNA; Therapeutic target","Humans; Neoplasms; RNA; RNA, Circular; Diseases; adenosine triphosphatase; circular ribonucleic acid; F box/WD repeat containing protein 7; g3bp stress granule assembly factor 1; heat responsive protein 12; microRNA; mitochondrial RNA; nanoparticle; ribonuclease P; RNA; RNA binding protein; RNA helicase; transcriptome; transfer RNA; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; upf1 RNA helicase and atpase; RNA; 'current; Cancer; Circrna; Delivery systems; High-throughput method; Non-coding RNA; State of the art; States of knowledge; Therapeutic targets; White card; alternative RNA splicing; Article; biogenesis; cancer chemotherapy; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; covalent bond; early cancer diagnosis; exosome; gene delivery system; gene expression; gene targeting; high throughput technology; human; immunogenicity; innate immunity; lung cancer cell line; malignant neoplasm; molecular biology; nerve cell; nervous tissue; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; phospholipid bilayer; prostate cancer; tissue specificity; genetics; neoplasm; RNA","","adenosine triphosphatase, 37289-25-1, 9000-83-3; interferon induced helicase C domain containing protein 1, ; ribonuclease P, 71427-00-4; RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA helicase, ; transfer RNA, 9014-25-9; RNA, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","","","Greene J., Et al., Circular RNAs: biogenesis, function and role in human diseases, Front.

Circular RNA (circRNA) constitutes a major class of non-coding RNAs that have been implicated in many human diseases, although their potential involvement in inflammatory skin diseases remains elusive. Here, we compare and contrast the circRNA expression landscapes in paired lesional and non-lesional skin from psoriasis and AD patients relative to skin from unaffected individuals using high-depth RNA-seq data. CircRNAs and their cognate linear transcripts were quantified using the circRNA detection algorithm, CIRI2, and in situ hybridization and Sanger sequencing was used for validation purposes. We identified 39,286 circRNAs among all samples and found that psoriasis and AD lesional skin could be distinguished from non-lesional and healthy skin based on circRNA expression landscapes. In general, circRNAs were less abundant in lesional relative to non-lesional and healthy skin. Differential expression analyses revealed many significantly downregulated circRNAs, mainly in psoriasis lesional skin, and a strong correlation between psoriasis and AD-related circRNA expression changes was observed. Two individual circRNAs, ciRS-7 (also known as CDR1as) and circZRANB1, were specifically dysregulated in psoriasis and show promise as biomarkers for discriminating AD from psoriasis. In conclusion, the circRNA transcriptomes of psoriasis and AD share expression features, including a global downregulation relative to healthy skin, but this is most pronounced in psoriasis, and only psoriasis is characterized by several circRNAs being dysregulated independently of their cognate linear transcripts. Finally, specific circRNAs could potentially be used to distinguish AD from psoriasis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Notably, breast cancer has a significant mortality rate and is one of the most common malignancies in women. CircRNAs have been demonstrated to contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer including its initiation, progression, metastasis, and resistance to drugs. By acting as miRNA sponges, circRNAs can indirectly influence gene expression by disrupting miRNA regulation of their target genes, ultimately altering the course of cancer development and progression. Additionally, circRNAs can interact with proteins and modulate their functions including signaling pathways involved in the initiation and development of cancer. Recently, circRNAs can encode peptides that play a role in the pathophysiology of breast cancer and other diseases and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various cancers including breast cancer. CircRNAs possess biomarkers that differentiate, such as stability, specificity, and sensitivity, and can be detected in several biological specimens such as blood, saliva, and urine. Moreover, circRNAs play an important role in various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, all of which are integral factors in the development and progression of cancer. This review synthesizes the functions of circRNAs in breast cancer, scrutinizing their contributions to the onset and evolution of the disease through their interactions with exosomes and cancer-related intracellular pathways. It also delves into the potential use of circRNA as a biomarker and therapeutic target against breast cancer. It discusses various databases and online tools that offer crucial circRNA information and regulatory networks. Lastly, the challenges and prospects of utilizing circRNAs in clinical settings associated with breast cancer are explored. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Breast cancer; circRNA; circRNA biomarkers; Exosomal circRNAs; miRNA sponges; Tumor-suppressive circRNAs","Biomarkers; Breast Neoplasms; Exosomes; Female; Humans; MicroRNAs; RNA, Circular; antineoplastic agent; circular intronic RNA; circular ribonucleic acid; competing endogenous RNA; exon intron circular RNA; exonic circular RNA; exosomal circular ribonucleic acid; microRNA; RNA binding protein; unclassified drug; biological marker; circular ribonucleic acid; microRNA; blood analysis; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer diagnosis; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer resistance; cancer staging; CRISPR Cas system; drug targeting; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene; gene expression regulation; gene function; gene regulatory network; genetic database; human; intracellular signaling; intron pairing; liquid biopsy; metastasis; molecular interaction; nonhuman; parental gene; protein RNA binding; radiosensitivity; Review; RNA analysis; RNA recombination; RNA splicing; RNA synthesis; RNA translation; signal transduction; tumor invasion; Warburg effect; breast tumor; exosome; female; genetics","","Biomarkers, ; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","Indian Council of Medical Research, ICMR; VIT University; Università degli Studi di Sassari, UNISS, (2022–2023, FAR2020-Pintus)","Funding text 1: The authors thank the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India for providing the necessary research facilities and encouragement to carry out this work.; Funding text 2: Open Access funding provided by the Qatar National Library.

Here, we introduce an updated online database (http://www.exoRBase.org), exoRBase 2.0, which is a repository of EV long RNAs (termed exLRs) derived from RNA-seq data analyses of diverse human body fluids. In exoRBase 2.0, the number of exLRs has increased to 19 643 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 15 645 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 79 084 circular RNAs (circRNAs) obtained from ∼1000 human blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bile samples. Importantly, exoRBase 2.0 not only integrates and compares exLR expression profiles but also visualizes the pathway-level functional changes and the heterogeneity of origins of circulating EVs in the context of different physiological and pathological conditions. Our database provides an attractive platform for the identification of novel exLR signatures from human biofluids that will aid in the discovery of new circulating biomarkers to improve disease diagnosis and therapy.  © 2022 The Author(s).","","Body Fluids; Databases, Genetic; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; RNA, Circular; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Seq; circular ribonucleic acid; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; adaptive immunity; Article; bile level; bioinformatics; blood level; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cerebrospinal fluid level; cohort analysis; controlled study; data base; disease association; entropy; exoRBase 2.0; exosome; gene expression profiling; high throughput sequencing; human; human cell; human tissue; innate immunity; memory B lymphocyte; pathway enrichment analysis; protein analysis; RNA analysis; RNA sequence; sequence alignment; transcriptomics; urine level; body fluid; chemistry; classification; exosome; genetic database; genetics","","RNA, Circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ; RNA, Messenger, ","","","Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, (2020CXJQ02); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81872294, 82072694, 82173063); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, (2019J01170); Science and Technology Innovation Plan Of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission, (20JC1419000)","Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan [20JC1419000]; Shanghai Municipal Health Commission [2020CXJQ02]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81872294, 82072694, 82173063]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2019J01170].

CircRNAs might regulate cellular processes by different mechanisms, including interaction with miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. CircRNAs are pleiotropic molecules whose dysregulation has been linked to human diseases and can drive cancer by impacting gene expression and signaling pathways. The detection of circRNAs aberrantly expressed in disease conditions calls for the investigation of their functions. Here, we propose CircIMPACT, a bioinformatics tool for the integrative analysis of circRNA and gene expression data to facilitate the identification and visualization of the genes whose expression varies according to circRNA expression changes. This tool can highlight regulatory axes potentially governed by circRNAs, which can be prioritized for further experimental study. The usefulness of CircIMPACT is exemplified by a case study analysis of bladder cancer RNA-seq data. The link between circHIPK3 and heparanase (HPSE) expression, due to the circHIPK3-miR558-HPSE regulatory axis previously determined by experimental studies on cell lines, was successfully detected. © 2021 by the authors.

Given its relatively large genome size for a virus and hence the capacity to store more than mere protein-coding information, EBV also harbours genetic material for producing an array of distinct noncoding (nc)RNAs. The double-stranded nature of its DNA genome allows the utilization of the whole gamut of ncRNA types, including both RNA polymerase II and III transcripts, in devising a sophisticated strategy to ensure its replication upon infection in host cells and evasion of host immune responses. Owing to the development of sensitive technologies in recent years, mostly entailing next-generation sequencing, the list of ncRNA types generated by EBV has expanded now to include two RNAs (EBER1 and EBER2) best categorized as long ncRNAs, dozens of microRNAs, one small nucleolar RNA, stable intronic sequence RNAs, and the most recently discovered circular RNAs. With the application of cutting-edge technology, the molecular mechanisms of some of these noncoding transcripts are beginning to emerge, while others remain yet to be elucidated. As viruses often take advantage of existing molecular pathways established by the host, it is likely that further novel concepts of the greatly unexplored noncoding world can be learned from studying the many EBV ncRNAs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","circRNAs; EBERs; Epstein-Barr virus; noncoding RNAs; sisRNAs","Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; MicroRNAs; RNA, Circular; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Untranslated; circular ribonucleic acid; DNA directed RNA polymerase III; genomic DNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; RNA polymerase II; small nucleolar RNA; untranslated RNA; virus RNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; untranslated RNA; DNA modification; DNA strand; Epstein Barr virus; genetic transcription; genome size; high throughput sequencing; host cell; immune response; intron; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; Review; sequence analysis; virus genome; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; metabolism; pathogenicity; pathology; virology","","MicroRNAs, ; RNA, Circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ; RNA, Untranslated, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (R21AI151073)","Funding text 1: N.L is supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant number R21 AI151073]. ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R21 AI151073].

This database was generated by integrating various direct and indirect evidences to predict coding potential of each human circRNA and the putative translation products. Seven types of evidences for circRNA translation were included: (i) ribosome/polysome binding evidences supporting the occupancy of ribosomes onto circRNAs; (ii) experimentally mapped translation initiation sites on circRNAs; (iii) internal ribosome entry site on circRNAs; (iv) published N-6-methyladenosine modification data in circRNA that promote translation initiation; (v) lengths of the circRNA specific open reading frames; (vi) sequence composition scores from a machine learning prediction of all potential open reading frames; (vii) mass spectrometry data that directly support the circRNA encoded peptides across back-splice junctions. TransCirc provides a user-friendly searching/browsing interface and independent lines of evidences to predicte how likely a circRNA can be translated. In addition, several flexible tools have been developed to aid retrieval and analysis of the data. TransCirc can serve as an important resource for investigating the translation capacity of circRNAs and the potential circRNA-encoded peptides, and can be expanded to include new evidences or additional species in the future.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

Recent studies have identified that the expression of candidate circRNAs are dysregulated in various tumors and hence are considered as promising diagnostic or therapeutic targets across cancer types. However, the expression and function of circRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this article, we investigated the expression of circRNAs in LUAD via MiOncoCirc, which is the first and comprehensive database characterizing circRNAs across >2,000 cancer samples using an exome capture RNA sequencing. We identified seven abnormally expressed circRNAs in LUAD, including circCDR1-AS, circHIPK3, circFNDC3B, circPCMTD1, circRHOBTB3, circFAM13B, and circMAN1A2, as well as conducted a literature review about the function and features of these circRNAs. Previous studies have demonstrated that circCDR1-AS, circMAN1A2, and circHIPK3 were upregulated and significantly correlated with a poor survival, or promoted the tumor progression in lung cancer, whereas other circRNAs have not been fully explored. Besides, we reviewed all the publications regarding circRNAs and LUAD, and noticed that the dysregulation of these circRNAs impacts the development of LUAD through a variety of regulatory mechanisms. In conclusion, the underlying mechanisms of aberrant expression and functions of circRNAs in LUAD are worthy of being further investigated. © Copyright © 2020 Zhao, Li, Liu, Wang, Li, Zhu, Lei and Xu.","biomarker;

A large number of circRNAs have been confirmed to be involved in cancer progression and are expected to become promising biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and targeted therapy. Deciphering the underlying relationships between circRNAs and diseases may provide new insights for us to understand the pathogenesis of complex diseases and further characterize the biological functions of circRNAs. As traditional experimental methods are usually time-consuming and laborious, computational models have made significant progress in systematically exploring potential circRNA-disease associations, which not only creates new opportunities for investigating pathogenic mechanisms at the level of circRNAs, but also helps to significantly improve the efficiency of clinical trials. In this review, we first summarize the functions and characteristics of circRNAs and introduce some representative circRNAs related to tumorigenesis. Then, we mainly investigate the available databases and tools dedicated to circRNA and disease studies. Next, we present a comprehensive review of computational methods for predicting circRNA-disease associations and classify them into five categories, including network propagating-based, path-based, matrix factorization-based, deep learning-based and other machine learning methods. Finally, we further discuss the challenges and future researches in this field.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

As shown for a few cases, these functions may be mediated by trans-acting factors, in particular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, the specific interaction partners for most circRNAs remain unknown. This is mainly due to technical difficulties in their identification and in differentiating between interactors of circRNAs and their linear counterparts. Here we review the currently used methodology to systematically study circRNA-protein complexes (circRNPs), focusing either on a specific RNA or protein, both on the gene-specific or global level, and discuss advantages and challenges of the available approaches. © 2021 The Author(s)","Circular RNAs (circRNAs); Ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs); RNA-binding proteins (RBPs); RNA-protein interactions","RNA; RNA, Circular; RNA-Binding Proteins; Trans-Activators; circular ribonucleic acid; fragile X mental retardation protein; RNA; RNA binding protein; transactivator protein; Article; binding affinity; cellular distribution; gel mobility shift assay; gene expression; gene overexpression; gene targeting; in vitro study; protein binding; protein cross linking; protein interaction; protein RNA binding; RNA analysis; RNA immunoprecipitation; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; RNA structure; RNA translation; sucrose gradient; chemistry; genetics; metabolism","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, ; RNA, Circular, ; RNA-Binding Proteins, ; Trans-Activators, ","","","LOEWE; State of Hessen; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (721890); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (18-2, Bi 316/18-1, Bi 316/20-1, FOR 5116, RTG 2355)","Funding is acknowledged from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (RTG 2355; projects Bi 316/18-1 and 18-2 within SPP 1935; to A.B.), project Bi 316/20-1 within Research Unit FOR 5116 (to A.B.), and the Cardio-Pulmonary Institute (CPI) within the Excellence Strategy Program Exc 2026 (to T.S.); additional funding was from the State of Hessen, LOEWE Centre DRUID (project E2, to A.B.).","Sanger H.L., Klotz G., Riesner D., Gross H.J., Kleinschmidt A.K., Viroids are single stranded covalently closed circular RNA molecules existing as highly base paired rod like structures, Proc.

In addition, web tools for analyzing lncRNA expression by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) are described. Lnc2Cancer 3.0 was updated with several new features, including (i) Increased cancer-associated lncRNA entries over the previous version. The current release includes 9254 lncRNA-cancer associations, with 2659 lncRNAs and 216 cancer subtypes. (ii) Newly adding 1049 experimentally supported circRNA-cancer associations, with 743 circRNAs and 70 cancer subtypes. (iii) Experimentally supported regulatory mechanisms of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs, involving microRNAs, transcription factors (TF), genetic variants, methylation and enhancers were included. (iv) Appending experimentally supported biological functions of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs including cell growth, apoptosis, autophagy, epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT), immunity and coding ability. (v) Experimentally supported clinical relevance of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs in metastasis, recurrence, circulation, drug resistance, and prognosis was included. Additionally, two flexible online tools, including RNA-seq and scRNA-seq web tools, were developed to enable fast and customizable analysis and visualization of lncRNAs in cancers. Lnc2Cancer 3.0 is a valuable resource for elucidating the associations between lncRNA, circRNA and cancer.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

Most circRNAs act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges to regulate the expression of functional genes. In addition, some circRNAs can be translated and interact with RNA-binding proteins to perform biological functions. The expression of circRNAs is prevalent in tissues and body fluids, and their abnormal expression is related to tumor progression. circRNAs are stable even under the treatment of RNase R because of their circular conformation. As circRNAs have construct sta bility, wide variety, specific regulation of tumor progression and high expression in body fluids, it is potential for cir cRNAs to serve as candidate diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets. However, the knowledge about circRNAs remains poor. In addition to the not completely resolved functions and generation mechanisms of circRNAs, the annota tions of circRNAs are also waiting for expanding. Here, we review the generation mechanisms, biological functions, and application of circRNAs in tumor research, aiming to provide integrated information for the future research. © 2021 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

This is also true for non-coding RNAs, with regulatory functions in a variety of processes such as differentiation, cell identity and metabolism. In line with their increasingly recognized roles in cellular pathways, RNAs are also currently evaluated as possible disease biomarkers. They could be informative not only to follow disease progression and assess treatment efficacy in clinics, but also to aid in the development of new therapeutic approaches. This is especially important for neurological and genetic disorders, where the administration of appropriate treatment during the disease prodromal stage could significantly delay, if not halt, disease progression. In this review we focus on the current status of biomarkers in Huntington’s Disease (HD), a fatal hereditary and degenerative disease condition. First, we revise the sources and type of wet biomarkers currently in use. Then, we explore the feasibility of different RNA types (miRNA, ncRNA, circRNA) as possible biomarker candidates, discussing potential advantages, disadvantages, sources of origin and the ongoing investigations on this topic. © 2022 by the authors.","biofluids; biomarkers; circRNA; Huntington’s disease; microRNA; neurodegeneration; non-coding RNA","Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Humans; Huntington Disease; MicroRNAs; RNA, Untranslated; biological marker; circular ribonucleic acid; huntingtin; hydrocortisone; microRNA; neurofilament protein; transcriptome; untranslated RNA; biological marker; microRNA; untranslated RNA; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; brain atrophy; cell differentiation; cerebrospinal fluid; degenerative disease; diagnostic procedure; disease exacerbation; disease severity; exosome; feasibility study; follow up; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic disorder; hematoma; heredity; human; Huntington chorea; long term depression; nerve cell plasticity; neurofilament; neurologic disease; neurology; nonhuman; protein synthesis; Review; RNA metabolism; spinal muscular atrophy; trinucleotide repeat; Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale; genetics; metabolism","","huntingtin, 191683-04-2; hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; Biomarkers, ; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, Untranslated, ","","","Huntington's Disease Society of America, HDSA","This research was supported by the Huntington’s Disease Society of America (HDSA) human biology award to M.B. and F.Q.","Hansson O., Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Nat.

Owing to their unique structure and stability, circular RNAs have a multitude of functional properties such as micro-RNA and protein sponges, direct and indirect modulators of gene expression, protein translation, and many unproven activities apart from being potential biomarkers. However, due to their low abundance, most of the global circular RNA identification is carried out by high-throughput NGS-based approaches requiring millions of sequencing reads. This lag in methodological advancements demands for newer, more refined, and efficient identification techniques. Here, we aim to show an improved version of our previously reported template-dependent multiple displacement amplification (tdMDA)-NGS method by superimposing the ribosomal depletion step and use of H minus reverse transcriptase and RNase H. Implication of tdMDA using highly replicative Phi29 DNA polymerase after minimizing the linear and ribosomal RNA content further intensifies its detection limit toward even the abysmally expressing circular RNA at a low NGS depth, thereby decreasing the cost of identifying a single circular RNA. A >11-fold and >6-fold increase in total circular RNA was identified from the improved-tdMDA-NGS method over the traditional method of circRNA sequencing using DCC and CIRI2 pipelines, respectively, from Oryza sativa subsp. Indica. Furthermore, the reliability of the improved-tdMDA-NGS method was also asserted in HeLa cell lines, showing a significant fold difference in comparison with the existing traditional method of circRNA sequencing. Among the identified circular RNAs, a significant percentage from both rice (∼58%) and HeLa cell lines (∼84%) is found to be matched with the previously reported circular RNAs, suggesting that the improved-tdMDA-NGS method can be adapted to detect and characterize the circular RNAs from different biological systems.

Earlier circRNAs were regarded as worthless and called junk RNAs produced due to splicing errors but recent progress in circRNA research indicated their considerable roles in various biological processes. However, plant circRNA research is still in initial stages as compared to animal circRNAs. In this review, we have summarized the process of circRNA biogenesis, how plant circRNAs are different from animals, various modules that can be used for the identification of circRNAs and different circRNA databases. We have also provided an overview of recent progress on our understanding about the involvement of circRNA in various abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants. A proper understanding of the role of circRNAs in different aspects of plant development and stress response will provide novel ways to manipulate plants for their enhanced survivability and productivity in adverse climatic conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Backsplicing; Biomarkers; CircRNA; MiRNA sponge; Stress responses","biomarker; database; RNA","","","","","DBT-BUILDER-Maharshi Dayanand University; DBT-Junior, (1019193); ICAR-IARI, (11552); ICAR-NIPB; Life Science Program for Advance Research and Education, (102/IFD/SAN/1796/2021–2022, BT/INF/22/SP43043/2021); Indian Council of Agricultural Research, ICAR","GK acknowledges the support of DBT-Junior Research Fellowship ( JRF ) (No. 1019193 ) and ICAR-IARI fellowship (No. 11552 ) for financial assistance from Department of Biotechnology and Indian Council of Agricultural Research , Govt. of India, New Delhi.

However, the molecular mechanisms as well as roles of circKIF4A in osteosarcoma (OS) have not yet been clearly elucidated. Methods: We evaluated the expression of circKIF4A in OS. Colony-formation, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell and mice metastasis model assays were done to explore the roles of circKIF4A in vitro and in vivo. TargetScan database, double luciferase, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-qPCR), and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) were done to investigate the associated molecular mechanisms. Results: In both OS cells and tissues, circKIF4A (hsa_circ_0007255) was found to be upregulated. In vitro and in vivo, circKIF4A knockdown markedly suppressed OS proliferation as well as metastasis. circKIF4A enhanced OS growth as well as metastasis by sponging miR-515-5p and by upregulating SLC7A11. Conclusions: We identified the biological significance of the circKIF4A-miR-515-5p-SLC7A11 axis in OS cell proliferation and metastasis, which is important in OS monitoring and treatment. More studies on circKIF4A will inform on the diagnostic markers for early OS screening.

This study aimed to reveal the circRNA-related regulatory mechanism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: A genome-wide circRNA microarray assay was performed to profile the expression of circRNAs in the blood of preoperative ESCC patients and healthy controls. A systematic method of data mining was performed to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the metaMA and RankProd analysis. Bioinformatics analyses and multiple tools were employed to construct the potential circRNA–miRNA–mRNA regulatory network. Results: Thirty-three differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in the ESCC blood, including 31 downregulated and two upregulated circRNAs in the blood of ESCC patients compared with the healthy controls. Twenty-three DEmiRs and 2,220 DEGs were obtained by the integration of microarray datasets. An ESCC-associated circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network was constructed based on 31 circRNAs, 3 DEmiRs, and 190 DEGs. Enrichment analyses indicated that the DEGs were associated with a series of biological processes and cancer-related pathways. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was generated by the 190 DEGs, with 10 hub genes verified in the network.

As biological data become abundant, a lot of computational prediction models have been used for circRNA–disease association prediction. However, existing prediction models ignore the non-linear information of circRNAs and diseases when fusing multi-source similarities. In addition, these models fail to take full advantage of the vital feature information of high-similarity neighbor nodes when extracting features of circRNAs or diseases. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model, CDA-SKAG, which introduces a similarity kernel fusion algorithm to integrate multi-source similarity matrices to capture the non-linear information of circRNAs or diseases, and construct a circRNA information space and a disease information space. The model embeds an attention-enhancing layer in the graph autoencoder to enhance the associations between nodes with higher similarity. A cost-sensitive neural network is introduced to address the problem of positive and negative sample imbalance, consequently improving our model’s generalization capability. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of our model CDA-SKAG outperformed existing circRNA–disease association prediction models. The results of the case studies on lung and cervical cancer suggest that CDA-SKAG can be utilized as an effective tool to assist in predicting circRNA–disease associations. ©2023 the Author(s)","attention mechanism; circRNA–disease association prediction; cost-sensitive neural network; graph autoencoder; similarity kernel fusion","Algorithms; Neural Networks, Computer; RNA, Circular; Deep learning; Graph neural networks; Learning systems; circular ribonucleic acid; Attention mechanisms; Auto encoders; Circrna–disease association prediction; Cost-sensitive neural networks; Disease associations; Graph autoencoder; Kernel fusion; Non linear; Prediction modelling; Similarity kernel fusion; algorithm; artificial neural network; Forecasting","","RNA, Circular, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62176177); Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province, (202303021211121)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 62176177; and the Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province, grant number 202303021211121.","Jeck W.

Researchers have revealed that circRNAs play an important role in human diseases. As experimental identification of interactions between circRNA and disease is time-consuming and expensive, effective computational methods are an urgent need for predicting potential circRNA–disease associations. In this study, we proposed a novel computational method named GATNNCDA, which combines Graph Attention Network (GAT) and multi-layer neural network (NN) to infer disease-related circRNAs. Specially, GATNNCDA first integrates disease semantic similarity, circRNA functional similarity and the respective Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarities. The integrated similarities are used as initial node features, and then GAT is applied for further feature extraction in the heterogeneous circRNA–disease graph. Finally, the NN-based classifier is introduced for prediction. The results of fivefold cross validation demonstrated that GATNNCDA achieved an average AUC of 0.9613 and AUPR of 0.9433 on the CircR2Disease dataset, and outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, case studies on breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma showed that 20 and 18 of the top 20 candidates were respectively confirmed in the validation datasets or published literature.

Identifying circular RNA through manual laboratories work is expensive, time-consuming and prone to errors. Development of computational methodologies for identification of circular RNA is an active area of research. State-of-the-art circular RNA identification methodologies make use of handcrafted features, which not only increase the feature space, but also extract irrelevant and redundant features. The paper in hand proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based framework named as CircNet, which does not require any handcrafted features. It takes raw RNA sequence as an input and utilises encoder–decoder based convolutional operations to learn lower-dimensional latent representation. This latent representation is further passed to another convolutional architecture to extract discriminative features followed by a classification layer. We performed extensive experimentation to highlight different regions of genome sequence that preserve the most important information for identifying circular RNAs. CircNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a considerable margin 10.29% in terms F1 measure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","Autoencoder;

Unlike the majority of RNAs, circRNAs are covalently closed, without a 5' end or a 3' poly(A) tail. A few circRNAs can be associated with polysomes, suggesting a protein-coding potential. CircRNAs are not degraded by RNA exonucleases or ribonuclease R and are enriched in exosomes. Recent developments in experimental methods coupled with evolving bioinformatic approaches have accelerated functional investigation of circRNAs, which exhibit a stable structure, a long half-life, and tumor specificity and can be extracted from body fluids and used as potential biological markers for tumors. Moreover, circRNAs may regulate the occurrence and development of cancers and contribute to drug resistance through a variety of molecular mechanisms. Despite the identification of a growing number of circRNAs, their effects in hematological cancers remain largely unknown. Recent studies indicate that circRNAs could also originate from fusion genes (fusion circRNAs, f-circRNAs) next to chromosomal translocations, which are considered the primary cause of various cancers, notably hematological malignancies. This Review will focus on circRNAs and f-circRNAs in hematological cancers. © 2021, Babin et al.","","Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; RNA, Circular; CD135 antigen; circular ribonucleic acid; exonuclease; imatinib; lysosome associated membrane protein 1; nucleophosmin; polyadenylic acid; ribonuclease; RNA binding protein; tumor marker; untranslated RNA; acute myeloid leukemia; anaplastic large cell lymphoma; bioinformatics; body fluid; carcinogenesis; chromosome translocation; chronic myeloid leukemia; covalent bond; drug resistance; drug targeting; enzyme degradation; gene fusion; genetic database; half life time; hematologic malignancy; high throughput sequencing; human; microarray analysis; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; polysome; promyelocytic leukemia; protein binding; protein expression; protein interaction; protein structure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; RNA degradation; RNA splicing; tissue specificity; genetics; hematologic disease","","exonuclease, 37228-74-3; imatinib, 152459-95-5, 220127-57-1; nucleophosmin, 117896-08-9; polyadenylic acid, 24937-83-5; ribonuclease, 59794-03-5, 9001-99-4; RNA, Circular, ","","","Labex TOUCAN/Laboratoire d’excellence Toulouse Cancer; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Inserm; Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin; Ligue Contre le Cancer; Fondation de France; Berlin Institute of Health, BIH; l’association Eva pour la vie","This work was supported by grants from the INSERM, La Fondation de France, La Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (to FM and EB: Equipes Labelisées 2017-2021), and l’association Eva pour la vie (to FM).

Previous studies have reported that certain circRNAs are differentially expressed in glioma and regulate a number of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, metastasis and oncogenesis of glioma. Furthermore, certain circRNAs have been associated with tumor size, World Health Organization tumor grade and poor prognosis in patients with glioma. It has been hypothesized that circRNAs may be involved in the onset and progression of glioma through transcriptional regulation, protein translation and binding to microRNAs. These properties and functions suggest the potential of circRNAs as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for glioma. For the present review, published studies were examined from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central and the reference lists of the retrieved articles. The aim of the present review was to summarize the progress of circRNA research in glioma, discuss the potential diagnostic and prognostic values, and the roles of circRNAs in glioma, and provide a novel theoretical basis and research concepts for the prediction, diagnosis and treatment of glioma. © 2021 Spandidos Publications.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant modification in the eukaryotic cells, is engaged in the pathophysiological processes of various diseases. An increasing amount of evidence has suggested that m6A modification is common in circRNAs and is associated with their biological functions. This review summarizes the effects of m6A modification on circRNAs and their regulation mechanisms in cancers, providing some suggestions of m6A-modified circRNAs in cancer therapy. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cancers; CircRNA; Metabolism; N6-methyladenosine; Non-coding RNAs","Humans; Neoplasms; RNA, Circular; 6 n methyladenosine; circular ribonucleic acid; methyltransferase; n demethylase; ribonuclease; ribonuclease R; unclassified drug; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epigenetic modification; gene function; genetic database; genetic modification; malignant neoplasm; methylated RNA immunoprecipitation; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory mechanism; Review; RNA immunoprecipitation; RNA modification; RNA synthesis; genetics; human; neoplasm","","6 n methyladenosine, 1867-73-8; methyltransferase, 9033-25-4; ribonuclease, 59794-03-5, 9001-99-4; RNA, Circular, ","","","Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81871720); Graduate Research and Innovation Projects of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX21_3116)","This project was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Number: 81871720], Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [Grant Number: KYCX21_3116].

Researchers without bioinformatics skills have difficulty in investigating these invaluable data or their own data. Here, we specifically designed circMine (http://hpcc.siat.ac.cn/circmine and http://www.biomedical-web.com/circmine/) that provides 1 821 448 entries formed by 136 871 circRNAs, 87 diseases and 120 circRNA transcriptome datasets of 1107 samples across 31 human body sites. circMine further provides 13 online analytical functions to comprehensively investigate these datasets to evaluate the clinical and biological significance of circRNA. To improve the data applicability, each dataset was standardized and annotated with relevant clinical information. All of the 13 analytic functions allow users to group samples based on their clinical data and assign different parameters for different analyses, and enable them to perform these analyses using their own circRNA transcriptomes. Moreover, three additional tools were developed in circMine to systematically discover the circRNA-miRNA interaction and circRNA translatability. For example, we systematically discovered five potential translatable circRNAs associated with prostate cancer progression using circMine. In summary, circMine provides user-friendly web interfaces to browse, search, analyze and download data freely, and submit new data for further integration, and it can be an important resource to discover significant circRNA in different diseases. © 2022 The Author(s).

CircRNAs are important molecules in the field of cancer diagnosis, as growing evidence suggests that they are closely related to pathological cancer features. Therefore, they have high potential for clinical use as novel cancer biomarkers. In this article, we present our updates to CircNet (version 2.0), into which circRNAs from circAtlas and MiOncoCirc, and novel circRNAs from The Cancer Genome Atlas database have been integrated. In total, 2732 samples from 37 types of cancers were integrated into CircNet 2.0 and analyzed using several of the most reliable circRNA detection algorithms. Furthermore, target miRNAs were predicted from the full-length circRNA sequence using three reliable tools (PITA, miRanda and TargetScan). Additionally, 384 897 experimentally verified miRNA-target interactions from miRTarBase were integrated into our database to facilitate the construction of high-quality circRNA-miRNA-gene regulatory networks. These improvements, along with the user-friendly interactive web interface for data presentation, search, and visualization, showcase the updated CircNet database as a powerful, experimentally validated resource, for providing strong data support in the biomedical fields.

These RNAs mediate post-transcriptional control of gene expression and have multiple functions in biological processes, such as transcriptional regulation and splicing. They serve predominantly as microRNA sponges, RNA-binding proteins, and templates for translation. More importantly, circRNAs are involved in cancer progression, and may serve as promising biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and therapy. Although traditional experimental methods are usually time-consuming and laborious, substantial progress has been made in exploring potential circRNA-disease associations by using computational models, summarized signaling pathway data, and other databases. Here, we review the biological characteristics and functions of circRNAs, including their roles in cancer. Specifically, we focus on the signaling pathways associated with carcinogenesis, and the status of circRNA-associated bioinformatics databases. Finally, we explore the potential roles of circRNAs as prognostic biomarkers in cancer. ©2023 Cancer Biology & Medicine.

LincSNP 3.0 has updated with several novel features, including (i) more types of variants including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), linkage disequilibrium SNPs (LD SNPs), somatic mutations and RNA editing sites have been expanded; (ii) more regulatory elements including transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), enhancers, DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), topologically associated domains (TADs), footprintss, methylations and open chromatin regions have been added; (iii) the associations among circRNAs, regulatory elements and variants have been identified; (iv) more experimentally supported variant-lncRNA/circRNA-disease/phenotype associations have been manually collected; (v) the sources of lncRNAs, circRNAs, SNPs, somatic mutations and RNA editing sites have been updated. Moreover, four flexible online tools including Genome Browser, Variant Mapper, Circos Plotter and Functional Annotation have been developed to retrieve, visualize and analyze the data. Collectively, LincSNP 3.0 provides associations among functional variants, regulatory elements, lncRNAs and circRNAs in diseases. It will serve as an important and continually updated resource for investigating functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs and circRNAs in diseases.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

A number of studies have highlighted the potential roles of both virus-encoded and host-encoded ncRNAs in viral infections, transmission and therapeutics. However, the role of an emerging type of noncoding transcript, circular RNA (circRNA) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has not been fully elucidated so far. Moreover, the potential pathogenic role of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis has not been fully explored as yet. The current study aimed to holistically map the regulatory networks driven by SARS-CoV-2 related circRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs to uncover plausible interactions and interplay amongst them in order to explore possible therapeutic options in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient datasets were analyzed systematically in a unified approach to explore circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression profiles. CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed based on cytokine storm related circRNAs forming a total of 165 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pairs. This study implies the potential regulatory role of the obtained circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and proposes that two differentially expressed circRNAs hsa_circ_0080942 and hsa_circ_0080135 might serve as a potential theranostic agents for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, the results shed light on the functional role of circRNAs as ceRNAs to sponge miRNA and regulate mRNA expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright: © 2023 Ayaz et al.

Evidence has shown that circRNAs are related to many biological processes and play essential roles in different biological functions. Although increasing numbers of circRNAs are discovered using high-throughput sequencing technologies, these techniques are still time-consuming and costly. In this study, we propose a computational method to predict circRNA-disesae associations which is based on metapath2vec++ and matrix factorization with integrated multiple data (called PCD MVMF). To construct more reliable networks, various aspects are considered. Firstly, circRNA annotation, sequence, and functional similarity networks are established, and disease-related genes and semantics are adopted to construct disease functional and semantic similarity networks. Secondly, metapath2vec++ is applied on an integrated heterogeneous network to learn the embedded features and initial prediction score. Finally, we use matrix factorization, take similarity as a constraint, and optimize it to obtain the final prediction results. Leave-one-out cross-validation, five-fold cross-validation, and f-measure are adopted to evaluate the performance of PCD MVMF. These evaluation metrics verify that PCD MVMF has better prediction performance than other methods. To further illustrate the performance of PCD MVMF, case studies of common diseases are conducted. Therefore, PCD MVMF can be regarded as a reliable and useful circRNA-disease association prediction tool. © 2018 Tsinghua University Press.","circRNA-disease associations; circular RNAs (circRNAs); matepath2vec++; matrix factorization","Constrained optimization; Factorization; Forecasting; Heterogeneous networks; Semantics; Statistical methods; Biological functions; Disease associations; Functional similarity; High-throughput sequencing; Integrated heterogeneous networks; Leave-one-out cross validations; Matrix factorizations; Prediction performance; Matrix algebra","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61672334, 61902230, 61972451); Shaanxi Normal University, (2018TS079); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61972451, 61672334, and 61902230) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Shaanxi Normal University (Nos.GK20190101O and 2018TS079).","Qu S., Yang X., Li X., Wang J., Gao Y., Shang R., Sun W., Dou K., Li H., Circular RNA: Anew star of noncoding RNAs, Cancer Letters, 365, 2, pp. 141-148, (2015); Salzman I., Gawad C., Wang P., Lacayo N., Brown P.O., Circular RNAs are the predominant transcript isoform from hundreds of human genes in diverse cell types, PLoS One, 7, 2, (2012); Chen L., Yang L., Regulation of circRNA biogenesis, RNA Biology, 12, 4, pp. 381-388, (2015); Sanger H.L., Klotz G., Riesner D., Gross H.J., Kleinschmidt A.K., Viroids are single-stranded covalently closed circular RNA molecules existing as highly base-paired rodlike structures, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Ofthe United States OfAmerica, 73, 11, pp. 3852-3856, (1976); Cocquerelle C., Daubersies P., Majerus M.A., Kerckaert J.P., Bailleul B., Splicing with inverted order of exons occurs proximal to large introns, EMBO Journal, 11, 3, pp. 1095-1098, (1992); Saad F.A., Vitiello L., Merlini L., Mostacciuolo M.L., Oliviero S., Danieli G.A., A 3' consensus splice mutation in the human dystrophin gene detected by a screening for intra-exonic deletions, Human Molecular Genetics, 1, 5, pp. 345-346, (1992); Zhang Y., Zhang X., Chen T., Xiang F., Yin Q.F., Xing Y.H., Zhu S., Yang L., Chen L.L., Circular intronic long noncoding RNAs, Molecular Cell, 51, 6, pp. 792-806, (2013); Li Z., Huang C., Bao C., Chen L., Lin M., Wang X., Zhong G., Yu B., Hu W., Dai L., Et al., Exon-intron circular RNAs regulate transcription in the nucleus, Nature Structure and Molecular Biology, 22, 3, pp. 256-264, (2015); Wilusz I.E., Sharp P.A., Molecular biology.

In humans, thousands of circRNA transcriptional products precisely express in specific developmental stages, tissues and cell types. Due to their stability and specificity, circRNAs are ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. To provide an integrated and standardized circRNA expression profile for human cancers, we performed extensive data curation across 11 technical platforms, collecting 48 expression profile data sets for 18 cancer types and amassing 860 751 expression records. We also identified 189 193 differential expression signatures that are significantly different between normal and cancer samples. All the pre-calculated expression analysis results are organized into 132 plain text files for bulk download. Our online interface, circExp, provides data browsing and search functions. For each data set, a dynamic expression heatmap provides a profile overview. Based on the processed data, we found that 52 circRNAs were consistently and differentially expressed in 20 or more processed analyses. By mapping those circRNAs to their parent protein-coding genes, we found that they may have profoundly affected the survival of 10 797 patients in the The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer data set. In sum, we developed circExp and demonstrated that it is useful to identify circRNAs that have potential diagnostic and prognostic significance for a variety of cancer types. In this online and reusable database, found at http://soft.bioinfo-minzhao.org/circexp, we have provided pre-calculated expression data about circRNAs and their parental genes, as well as data browsing and searching functions.

However, circRNAs’ roles in different tissues of apple are currently unknown. A total of 6495 unique circRNAs were identified from roots, phloem, leaves, flowers and fruits; 65.99% of them were intergenic circRNAs. Similar to other plants, tissue-specific expression was also observed for apple circRNAs; only 175 (2.69%) circRNAs were prevalently expressed in all five different tissues, while 1256, 1064, 912, 904 and 1080 circRNAs were expressed only in roots, phloem, leaves, flowers and fruit, respectively. The hosting-genes of circRNAs showed significant differences enriched in COG, GO terms or KEGG pathways in five tissues, suggesting the special functions of circRNAs in different tissues. Potential binding interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs were investigated using TargetFinder; 2989 interactions between 647 circRNAs and 192 miRNA were predicated in the present study. It also predicted that Chr00:18744403|18744580-mdm-miR160 might play an important role in the formation of flowers or in regulating the coloration of flowers, Chr10:6857496|6858910–mdm-miR168 might be involved in response to drought stress in roots, and Chr03:1226434|1277176 may absorb mdm-miR482a-3p and play a major role in disease resistance. Two circRNAs were experimentally analyzed by qRT-PCR with divergent primers, the expression levels were consistent with RNA-seq, which indicates that the RNA-seq datasets were reliable. © 2022 by the authors.

Growing evidence in the field of biomarker discovery has shown the promising use of nucleic acid in the early detection of many cancers, including HCC. Here, we review data on how various long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) could be used as a diagnostic tool for HCC being differentially expressed in HCC compared to non-HCC patients. These non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) showed high stability in the blood being present as free-circulating molecules or encapsulated into exosomes. This review reports some recent evidence on the use of lncRNAs and circRNAs as possible diagnostic biomarkers for HCC. Further, their pathophysiological mechanism in liver carcinogenesis was also described, elucidating the complex regulatory networks making these ncRNAs of particular relevance for the study of liver malignancy cancer. © 2021 by the authors.

Numerous studies have found that circRNAs play an important role in various diseases and have a variety of biological regulatory mechanisms, including acting as microRNA sponges, interacting with proteins, modulating the expression of related genes and translating into peptides or proteins. CircRNAs have also been used as biomarkers for a number of diseases, which could improve clinical practice. This review summarizes the most recent advances in biogenesis and knowledge of the biological functions of circRNAs as well as the related bioinformatics databases. We specifically describe developments in understanding of circRNA functions in the field of environmental exposure-induced diseases. Finally, we focus on potential clinical implications of circRNAs to facilitate their clinical transformation into disease treatment. © 2023 by the Journal of Biomedical Research.","biogenesis; biomarkers;

Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells reshapes the tumor microenvironment and can suppress antitumor immunity. Here, we discovered a novel circular RNA, termed circRHBDD1, which augments aerobic glycolysis and restricts anti-PD-1 therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mechanistic studies revealed that circRHBDD1 recruits the m6A reader YTHDF1 to PIK3R1 mRNA and accelerates the translation of PIK3R1 in an m6A-dependent manner. EIF4A3-mediated exon back-splicing contributes to the upregulation of circRHBDD1. Moreover, circRHBDD1 is highly expressed in anti-PD-1 responder HCC patients, and targeting circRHBDD1 improves anti-PD-1 therapy in an immune-competent mouse model. Overall, these findings illustrate the metabolic importance of the circRHBDD1/YTHDF1/PIK3R1 axis in HCC and show that suppression of circRHBDD1 may bolster the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy for HCC treatment. © 2022 The Author(s)","circular RNA; glycolysis; hepatocellular carcinoma; PIK3R1; YTHDF1","2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; alpha fetoprotein; antineoplastic monoclonal antibody; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; chloroquine; circular ribonucleic acid; circular ribonucleic acid RHBDD1; glucose 6 phosphate; glucose transporter 1; hexokinase; hexokinase 2; immunoglobulin G; Ki 67 antigen; messenger RNA; oncoprotein; pd 1 antibody; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase R1; proteasome; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; ythdf1 protein; adult; aerobic glycolysis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; cancer immunotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer survival; cell proliferation; controlled study; differential gene expression; disease free survival; distant metastasis; down regulation; drug targeting; exon; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression profiling; genetic algorithm; glycolysis; HCCLM3 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; hepatectomy; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; immunocompetence; immunohistochemistry; liver cell carcinoma; liver tissue; MHCC97-H cell line; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; normal human; overall survival; Pi3K/Akt signaling; protein degradation; RNA immunoprecipitation; RNA sequencing; RNA splicing; RNA translation; Sanger sequencing; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment; tumor number; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; upregulation; Western blotting","","2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone, 154447-36-6; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal, 133407-82-6; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7, 1446-17-9; glucose 6 phosphate, 56-73-5; glucose transporter 1, 172077-08-6; hexokinase, 9001-51-8; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9, 308067-58-5; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; proteasome, 140879-24-9","ly 294002","","Support Plan for Outstanding Young Talents of Anhui Education Department, (gxyq2021257); Talent Introduction Science Foundation of Yijishan Hospital, (YR202109, YR202110); Yijishan Hospital; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82002556, 82103293, 82172651); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, (1908085QH332, 2108085MH287); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20201083); Wannan Medical College, WNMC, (GF2019G17, GF2019J08); Anhui Provincial Key Research and Development Plan, (202104j07020019)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 82002556 , 82103293 , and 82172651 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (no.

The importance of non-coding RNAs such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized in the development of HCC. In this study, we constructed a four-component competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network in HCC and evaluated prognostic values of the ceRNAs. Materials and Methods: The expression profiles of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. GSE94508 and GSE97332 studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were used to identify circRNAs expression profiles. A four-component ceRNA network was constructed based on differentially-expressed RNAs. Survival R package was utilized to identify potential prognostic biomarkers. Results: A four-component ceRNA network including 295 edges and 239 nodes was constructed and enrichment analysis revealed important Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. A Protein-Protein Interaction network with 118 nodes and 301 edges was also established. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was the highest degree hub gene in the PPI network. Because of the significance of EZH2 in HCC, we presented its axes in the ceRNA network, which play important roles in HCC progression. Furthermore, ceRNAs were identified as potential prognostic biomarkers utilizing survival analysis. Conclusion: Our study elucidates the role of ceRNAs and their regulatory interactions in the pathogenesis of HCC and identifies EZH2-related RNAs which may be utilized as novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers in the future. © 2022 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

Herein, we systematically searched for neuropathic pain-related ncRNAs expression changes, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular non-coding RNAs (circRNAs). Methods: We searched two databases, PubMed and GeenMedical, for relevant studies. Results: Peripheral nerve injury or noxious stimuli can induce extensive changes in the expression of ncRNAs. For example, higher serum miR-132-3p, -146b-5p, and -384 was observed in neuropathic pain patients. Either sciatic nerve ligation, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) transaction, or ventral root transection (VRT) could upregulate miR-21 and miR-31 while downregulating miR-668 and miR-672 in the injured DRG. lncRNAs, such as early growth response 2-antisense-RNA (Egr2-AS-RNA) and Kcna2-AS-RNA, were upregulated in Schwann cells and inflicted DRG after nerve injury, respectively. Dysregulated circRNA homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 3 (circHIPK3) in serum and the DRG, abnormally expressed lncRNAs X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1), as well as ciRS-7, zinc finger protein 609 (cirZNF609), circ_0005075, and circAnks1a in the spinal cord were suggested to participate in neuropathic pain development. Dysregulated miRNAs contribute to neuropathic pain via neuroinflammation, autophagy, abnormal ion channel expression, regulating pain-related mediators, protein kinases, structural proteins, neurotransmission excitatory–inhibitory imbalances, or exosome miRNA-mediated neuron–glia communication. In addition, lncRNAs and circRNAs are essential in neuropathic pain by acting as antisense RNA and miRNA sponges, epigenetically regulating pain-related molecules expression, or modulating miRNA processing. Conclusions: Numerous dysregulated ncRNAs have been suggested to participate in neuropathic pain development. However, there is much work to be done before ncRNA-based analgesics can be clinically used for various reasons such as conservation among species, proper delivery, stability, and off-target effects. © 2022 The Authors.

CircRNAs are widely distributed in organisms and have the features of time- and tissue-specific expressions. CircRNAs have attracted increasing interest from scientists because of their non-negligible effects on the growth and development of organisms. The translation capability of circRNAs is a novel and valuable direction in the functional research of circRNAs. To explore the translation potential of circRNAs, some progress has been made in both experimental identification and computational prediction. For computational prediction, both CircCode and CircPro are ribosome profiling-based software applications for predicting translatable circRNAs, and the online databases riboCIRC and TransCirc analyze as many pieces of evidence as possible and list the predicted translatable circRNAs of high confidence. Simultaneously, mass spectrometry in proteomics is often recognized as an efficient method to support the identification of protein and peptide sequences from diverse complex templates. However, few applications fully utilize mass spectrometry to predict translatable circRNAs. Therefore, this research aims to build up a scientific analysis pipeline with two salient features: 1) it starts with the data analysis of raw tandem mass spectrometry data; and 2) it also incorporates other translation evidence such as IRES. The pipeline has been packaged into an analysis tool called mass spectrometry to translatable circRNAs (MStoCIRC). MStoCIRC is mainly implemented by Python3 language programming and could be downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/QUMU00/mstocirc-master). The tool contains a main program and several small, independent function modules, making it more multifunctional. MStoCIRC can process data efficiently and has obtained hundreds of translatable circRNAs in humans and Arabidopsis thaliana.

To date, numerous studies have been performed on circRNAs and the proteins they encode. In this review, we summarize the biogenesis of circRNAs and the mechanisms regulating circRNA-encoded proteins expression. We also describe relevant research methods and their applications to biological processes such as tumour cell proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, autophagy and chemoresistance. This paper offers deeper insights into the roles that circRNA-encoded proteins play in tumours. It also provides a theoretical basis for the use of circRNA-encoded proteins as biomarkers of tumorigenesis and for the development of new targets for tumour therapy. © 2023 The Authors.

CircRNAs are generally produced by a noncanonical splicing event called backsplicing that is dependent on the canonical splicing machinery, giving rise to circRNAs classified into three main categories: exonic circRNA, circular intronic RNA, and exon–intron circular RNA. Notably, circRNAs possess functional importance and display their functions through different mechanisms of action including sponging miRNAs, or even being translated into functional proteins. In addition, circRNAs also have great potential as biomarkers, particularly in cancer, thanks to their high stability, tissue type and developmental stage specificity, and their presence in biological fluids, which make them promising candidates as noninvasive biomarkers. In this chapter, we describe the most commonly used techniques for the study of circRNAs as cancer biomarkers, including high-throughput techniques such as RNA-Seq and microarrays, and other methods to analyze the presence of specific circRNAs in patient samples. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Biogenesis;

Viruses can encode circRNA, and viral circRNAs have been found in multiple single-stranded and double-stranded viruses. However, the characteristics and functions of viral circRNAs remain unknown. Sequence alignment showed that viral circRNAs are less conserved than circRNAs in animal, indicating that the viral circRNAs may evolve rapidly. Through the analysis of the sequence characteristics of viral circRNAs and circRNAs in animal, it was found that viral circRNAs and animals circRNAs are similar in nucleic acid composition, but have obvious differences in secondary structure and autocorrelation characteristics. Based on these characteristics of viral circRNAs, machine learning algorithms were employed to construct a prediction model to identify viral circRNA. Additionally, analysis of the interaction between viral circRNA and miRNAs showed that viral circRNA is expected to interact with 518 human miRNAs, and preliminary analysis of the role of viral circRNA. And it has been also found that viral circRNAs may be involved in many KEGG pathways related to nervous system and cancer.

Agustín Escardino 9, Paterna, 46980, Spain","Gene silencing for functional studies in plants has been largely facilitated by manipulating viral genomes with inserts from host genes to trigger virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) against the corresponding mRNAs. However, viral genomes encode multiple proteins and can disrupt plant homeostasis by interfering with endogenous cell mechanisms. To try to circumvent this functional limitation, we have developed a silencing method based on the minimal autonomously-infectious nucleic acids currently known: viroids, which lack proven coding capability. The genome of Eggplant latent viroid, an asymptomatic viroid, was manipulated with insertions ranging between 21 and 42 nucleotides. Our results show that, although larger insertions might be tolerated, the maintenance of the secondary structure appears to be critical for viroid genome stability. Remarkably, these modified ELVd molecules are able to induce systemic infection promoting the silencing of target genes in eggplant. Inspired by the design of artificial microRNAs, we have developed a simple and standardized procedure to generate stable insertions into the ELVd genome capable of silencing a specific target gene. Analogously to VIGS, we have termed our approach viroid-induced gene silencing, and demonstrate that it is a promising tool for dissecting gene functions in eggplant. © 2022 The Authors.

Learning these irregular data in graphs is challenging and still suffers from shallow learning. Applying deep learning on graphs has demonstrated good performance in many applications including social analysis, bioinformatics etc. Message passing graph convolution network is a powerful method which has expressive power to learn graph structures. Meanwhile, circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) is a type of non-coding RNA which plays a critical role in human diseases. Identifying the associations between circRNAs and diseases is important for diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases. However, there are limited number of known associations between them and conducting biological experiments to identify new associations is time consuming and expensive. As a result, there is a need of building efficient and feasible computation methods to predict potential circRNA-disease associations. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolution network framework to learn features from a graph built with multi-source similarity information to predict circRNA-disease associations. First we use multi-source information of circRNA similarity, disease and circRNA Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity to extract the features using first graph convolution. Then we predict disease associations for each circRNA with a second graph convolution. Proposed framework with five-fold cross validation on various experiments shows promising results in predicting circRNA-disease association and outperforms other existing methods. © 2020 IEEE.","circRNA-disease associations;

Studies have shown that non-coding RNAs associated with secondary injuries, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis, are differentially expressed after spinal cord injury. Therefore, non-coding RNAs have potential as therapeutic targets after spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: Based on the latest research progress, to review the functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of non-coding RNAs in spinal cord injury, in order to provide new ideas for clinical treatment of spinal cord injury. METHODS: Using “spinal cord injury” AND “non-coding RNA” OR “microRNA” OR “long non-coding RNA” OR “circRNA” AND “oxidative stress” OR “inflammation” OR “autophagy” OR “apoptosis” as English and Chinese keywords, PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI and WanFang databases were searched. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 75 articles were reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: After spinal cord injury, non-coding RNAs associated with secondary injury such as oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis were significantly differentially expressed, resulting in differential expression of target genes and changes in cell functions. Regulating non-coding RNAs to antagonize oxidative stress, intervening microglia activation, polarization and inflammatory pathways to reduce inflammation, maintaining moderate levels of autophagy and keeping autophagy flux unobstructed, and inhibiting apoptosis may be the breakthrough points to promote the repair of spinal cord injury. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Therefore, accurately identifying CircRNA binding sites is of great importance for gene regulation. In previous studies, most of the methods are based on single-view or multi-view features. Considering that single-view methods provide less effective information, the current mainstream methods mainly focus on extracting rich relevant features by constructing multiple views. However, the increasing number of views leads to a large amount of redundant information, which is detrimental to the detection of CircRNA binding sites. Therefore, to solve this problem, we propose to use the channel attention mechanism to further obtain useful multi-view features by filtering out invalid information in each view. First, we use five feature encoding schemes to construct multi-view. Then, we calibrate the features by generating the global representation of each view, filtering out redundant information to retain important feature information. Finally, features obtained from multiple views are fused to detect RNA binding sites. To validate the effectiveness of the method, we compared its performance on 37 CircRNA-RBP datasets with existing methods. Experimental results show that the average AUC performance of our method is 93.85%, which is better than the current state-of-the-art methods.

We investigated and examined the utility of plasma circERBB2 as a prognostic biomarker in 70 patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy. We investigated by real-time quantitative PCR the circERBB2 concentrations in the preoperative and postoperative plasma and the circERBB2 expression in the resected tumors. The relationships between circERBB2 concentration in plasma and the clinicopathological features and prognosis were analyzed. circERBB2 was detected in the preoperative plasma samples of 37 patients. The presence of circERBB2 in preoperative plasma (high group) was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P =.035) and tended to be correlated with men (P =.069). Both relapse-free and overall survival were significantly poor in the high group (P =.001 and P =.009, respectively). The Cox proportional-hazard model revealed that the high group was an independent prognostic factor of relapse-free survival (P =.038). Among 16 patients of the high group, 13 patients did not show circERBB2 in the postoperative plasma. The concentration of circERBB2 in plasma was significantly higher in patients with recurrent cancer than those recurrence-free patients (P <.001). In 2 patients with recurrent cancer, plasma circERBB2 concentrations were increased, whereas, in 2 recurrence-free patients, these concentrations hardly changed during the treatment progress. The circERBB2 concentrations in preoperative plasma samples can be considered as a noninvasive prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer. Furthermore, monitoring the postoperative plasma circERBB2 concentrations may be useful for detecting gastric cancer recurrences. © 2020 The Authors.

In recent years, a trend has emerged of EC being manifested in younger women, and its overall incidence is gradually rising. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are novel endogenous transcripts that have limited ability to encode proteins due to their covalent closed‑loop structure, which differs from that of other types of RNA. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that circRNAs fulfill an important role in lung cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, EC and other malignant tumor types, and they can affect the occurrence and development of these malignancies through a variety of pathways, further demonstrating the potential of circRNAs as molecular biomarkers for the diagnosis, treat‑ ment and prognosis of malignant tumors. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the current understanding of the biogenesis and effects of circRNAs, and to discuss the expression, function and underlying mechanism of circRNAs in EC in order to identify potential novel biomarkers. © 2022 Spandidos Publications.

Recently, the role of these molecules in the regulation of gene expression and their involvement in several human pathologies has gained notoriety. The identification of circRNAs is highly dependent on computational methods for analyzing RNA sequencing data. However, bioinformatics software is known to be problematic in terms of usability. Evidence points out that tools for identifying circRNAs can have such problems, negatively impacting researchers in this field. Here we present a heuristic-based framework for evaluating the usability of command-line circRNA identification software. Methods: We used heuristics evaluation to comprehensively identify the usability issues in a sample of circRNA identification tools. Results: We identified 46 usability issues presented individually in four tools. Most of the issues had cosmetic or minor severity. These are unlikely to challenge experienced users but may cause inconvenience for novice users. We also identified severe issues with the potential to harm users regardless of their experience. The areas most affected were the documentation and the installability of the tools. Conclusions: With the proposed framework, we formally describe, for the first time, the usability problems that can affect users in this area of circRNA research. We hope that our framework can help researchers evaluate their software's usability during development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bioinformatics; circRNA; Command-line interface; Heuristic evaluation; Usability","Computational Biology; Heuristics; Humans; RNA, Circular; Software; Bioinformatics; Gene expression; Heuristic methods; Usability engineering; circular ribonucleic acid; Circrna; Closed-loop; Command line; Command-line interface; Genes expression; Heuristic evaluation; Identification tools; Tool development; Usability; Usability evaluation; Article; bioinformatics; evaluation study; heuristics; human; RNA analysis; biology; genetics; software; RNA","","RNA, Circular, ","","","Luana Müller; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia em Neuroimunomodulação, INCT-NIM","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the external heuristic evaluators for their careful and voluntary contribution.

However, the biogenesis and regulatory mechanisms of virus-encoded circRNAs in host cells remain unknown. In this study, we used the circRNA detection tool CIRI2 to systematically determine the virus-encoded circRNAs in virus-infected cancer cell lines and cancer patients, by analysing RNA-Seq datasets derived from RNase R-treated samples. Based on the thousands of viral circRNAs we identified, the biological characteristics and potential roles of viral circRNAs in regulating host cell function were determined. In addition, we developed a Viral-circRNA Database (http://www.hywanglab.cn/vcRNAdb/), which is open to all users to search, browse and download information on circRNAs encoded by viruses upon infection. © 2022 The Authors.","host cells; RNA-Seq; RNase R; viral circRNA; Viral-circRNA Database","Cell Line; Humans; RNA; RNA, Circular; Viruses; RNA; cell line; genetics; human; metabolism; virus","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31771469); Tongji University; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFC0908500)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31771469), and the National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFC0908500).; Funding text 2: information This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31771469), and the National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFC0908500).

Sensitive and quantitative detection of circRNA is of particular significance. However, conventional qRT-PCR is not appropriate for accurate quantification due to the strand-substitution potential during the reverse transcription, which has severely hindered the studies of circRNA. Here, we present a sensitive assay for the detection of circRNA using reverse transcription-hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (RT-HRCA). We further developed droplet digital RT-HRCA (ddRT-HRCA) for circRNA quantification using the microfluidic device. We demonstrate the ddRT-HRCA, modeled on circHIPK3, can achieve a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 6.6 aM with excellent selectivity. As far as we know, this is the first digital isothermal platform for quantitative analysis of low-abundance circRNA, which could be applied in liquid biopsy for early diagnosis and prognosis. This novel strategy paves new avenues for the development of the digital platform for accurate quantification of circRNA, to further promote this cutting-edge research area. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Absolute quantification; Circular RNA; Digital method; Hyperbranched rolling circle amplification","Diagnosis; Digital microfluidics; Polymerase chain reaction; Absolute quantification; Accurate quantifications; Circular RNA; Diagnosis and prognosis; Digital methods; Hyperbranched; Hyperbranched rolling circle amplification; Reverse transcription; Rolling circle amplifications; Sensitive detection; RNA","","","","","Key Laboratory of Sensing Technology and Biomedical Instruments of Guangdong Province, (2020B1212060077); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22004135, 31770849); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (20200824162253002, GXWD20201231165807008, JCYJ20190807160401657); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFF0703300)","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFF0703300), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22004135, 31770849), and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (JCYJ20190807160401657, GXWD20201231165807008, 20200824162253002).

CircRNAs can regulate cellular processes by different mechanisms, including interaction with microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBP), and encoding specific peptides. The prediction of circRNA functions is instrumental to interpret their impact in diseases, and to prioritize circRNAs for functional investigation. Currently, circRNA functional predictions are provided by web databases that do not allow custom analyses, while self-standing circRNA prediction tools are mostly limited to predict only one type of function, mainly focusing on the miRNA sponge activity of circRNAs. To solve these issues, we developed CRAFT (CircRNA Function prediction Tool), a freely available computational pipeline that predicts circRNA sequence and molecular interactions with miRNAs and RBP, along with their coding potential. Analysis of a set of circRNAs with known functions has been used to appraise CRAFT predictions and to optimize its setting. CRAFT provides a comprehensive graphical visualization of the results, links to several knowledge databases, and extensive functional enrichment analysis. Moreover, it originally combines the predictions for different circRNAs. CRAFT is a useful tool to help the user explore the potential regulatory networks involving the circRNAs of interest and generate hypotheses about the cooperation of circRNAs into the modulation of biological processes.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Growing evidence shows that circular RNAs play important roles in life processes and have great potential implications in clinical and research fields. The accurate modeling of circRNAs structure and stability has far-reaching impact on our understanding of their functions and our ability to develop RNA-based therapeutics. The cRNAsp12 server offers a user-friendly web interface to predict circular RNA secondary structures and folding stabilities from the sequence. Through the helix-based landscape partitioning strategy, the server generates distinct ensembles of structures and predicts the minimal free energy structures for each ensemble with the recursive partition function calculation and backtracking algorithms. For structure predictions in the limited structural ensemble, the server also provides users with the option to set the structural constraints of forcing the base pairs and/or forcing the unpaired bases, such that only structures that meet the criteria are enumerated recursively. © 2023 by the authors.","alternative structures; circular RNAs; folding stability; secondary structure prediction; web server","Algorithms; Internet; Nucleic Acid Conformation; RNA; RNA, Circular; Software; circular ribonucleic acid; RNA; Article; controlled study; entropy; human; partition coefficient; prediction; protein folding; protein secondary structure; protein stability; RNA sequence; RNA structure; algorithm; conformation; genetics; Internet; software","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12074151)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (12074151).","Memczak S., Jens M., Elefsinioti A., Torti F., Krueger J., Rybak A., Circular RNAs are a large class of animal RNAs with regulatory potency, Nature, 495, pp. 333-338, (2013); Holdt L.M., Stahringer A., Sass K., Pichler G., Kulak N.A., Wilfert W., Circular non-coding RNA ANRIL modulates ribosomal RNA maturation and atherosclerosis in humans, Nat.

However, with strict high-throughput techniques based on traditional biological experiments and the conditions and environment, the association between circRNA and miRNA can be discovered to be labor-intensive, expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient. In this paper, we proposed a novel computational model based on Word2vec, Structural Deep Network Embedding (SDNE), Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Neural Network, which predicts the potential circRNA-miRNA associations, called Word2vec, SDNE, Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Neural Network (WSCD). Specifically, the WSCD model extracts attribute feature and behaviour feature by word embedding and graph embedding algorithm, respectively, and ultimately feed them into a feature fusion model constructed by combining Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Neural Network to deduce potential circRNA-miRNA interactions. The proposed method is proved on dataset and obtained a prediction accuracy and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 81.61% and 0.8898, respectively, which is shown to have much higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art models and classifier models in prediction. In addition, 23 miRNA-related circular RNAs (circRNAs) from the top 30 were confirmed in relevant experiences. In these works, all results represent that WSCD would be a helpful supplementary reliable method for predicting potential miRNA-circRNA associations compared to wet laboratory experiments.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic deterioration and epigenetic alterations induced by environmental contaminants may contribute to the early detection and prevention of cancer. However, the role and regulatory mechanisms of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the B[a]P-induced DNA damage response (DDR) have not been elucidated. In this study, human bronchial epithelial cell lines (16HBE and BEAS-2B) were exposed to various concentrations of B[a]P, and BALB/c mice were treated with B[a]P intranasally. B[a]P exposure was found to induce DNA damage and upregulate circular RNA hsa_circ_0057504 (circ_0057504) expression in vitro and in vivo. In addition, B[a]P upregulated TMEM194B mRNA and circ_0057504 expression through inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) expression in vitro. Modulation (overexpression or knockdown) of circ_0057504 expression levels using a lentiviral system in human bronchial epithelial cells revealed that circ_0057504 promoted B[a]P-induced DNA damage. RNA pull-down and western blot assays showed that circ_0057504 interacted with non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding (NONO) and splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (SFPQ) proteins and regulated formation of the NONO-SFPQ protein complex. Thus, our findings indicate that circ_0057504 acts as a novel regulator of DNA damage in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to B[a]P. The current study reveals novel insights into the role of circRNAs in the regulation of genetic damage, and describes the effect and regulatory mechanisms of circ_0057504 on B[a]P genotoxicity. © 2022 The Authors","B[a]P; circRNA; DNA damage; DNMT3A; NONO-SFPQ complex","Animals; Benzo(a)pyrene; DNA Damage; DNA-Binding Proteins; Epigenomics; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Mice; RNA-Binding Proteins; Amino acids; Cell culture; Cells; Deterioration; DNA; Mammals; Proteins; Pyrene; benzo[a]pyrene; DNA methyltransferase 3A; non POU domain containing octamer binding; peptides and proteins; PTB associated splicing factor; unclassified drug; benzo[a]pyrene; DNA binding protein; NONO protein, human; Nono protein, mouse; RNA binding protein; Benzo(a)pyrene; Circrna; DNA damages; DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha; DNA-methyltransferase; Exposed to; Human bronchial epithelial cells; In-vitro; NONO-SFPQ complex; Regulatory mechanism; cell organelle; DNA; experimental study; gene expression; laboratory method; physiological response; RNA; 16HBE14o- cell line; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; Bagg albino mouse; BEAS-2B cell line; bronchus epithelium; concentration (parameter); controlled study; DNA damage; epithelium cell; genetic damage; genotoxicity; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; upregulation; animal; DNA damage; epigenetics; epithelium cell; RNA","","benzo[a]pyrene, 50-32-8; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase, ; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1, ; DNA methyltransferase 3A, ; DNA methyltransferase 3B, ; Benzo(a)pyrene, ; DNA-Binding Proteins, ; NONO protein, human, ; Nono protein, mouse, ; RNA-Binding Proteins, ","","","Key Medical Disciplines and Specialties Program of Guangzhou, (2021-2023); Open Research Fund of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, (202011-108); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81872652, 82130095)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 82130095 , 81872652 to J.Y.), Open Research Fund of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan People's Hospital (202011-108 to J.Y.), and the Key Medical Disciplines and Specialties Program of Guangzhou (2021-2023).

The identification of circRNA from other lncRNA is necessary for relevant research. In this study, we designed attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) network architecture fed with a raw se-quence, to learn the sparse features of RNA sequences and to accomplish the circRNAs identification task. The model outperformed the state-of-art models. Moreover, following the validation of the attention mechanism effectiveness by the handwritten digit dataset, the key sequence loci underlying circRNA’s recognition were obtained based on the corresponding attention score. Then, motif enrich-ment analysis identified some of the key motifs for circRNA formation. In conclusion, we designed deep learning network architecture suitable for learning gene sequences with sparse features and implemented it for the circRNA identification task, and the model has strong representation capability in the indication of some key loci. © 2021 by the authors.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a key role in mediating tumorigenesis. However, the functions and mechanisms of circRNAs in GM are still not fully understood. A circRNA microarray was performed to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in GM and non-cancerous specimens. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to detect circ-aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase (ASPH) expres- sion in GM tissues and cells. The clinical importance of circ-ASPH was investigated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The functions of circ-ASPH were investigated in LN229 and U87MG cells. Bioinformatics, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays were used to explore the mechanisms of circ-ASPH in GM. circ-ASPH levels were upregulated in GM specimens and cells. The prognostic role of circ-ASPH was identified in patients with GM. Loss/gain of function assays demonstrated that circ-ASPH increased cell proliferation, migration and inva- sion in GM cells. Mechanistically, circ-ASPH counteracted microRNA (miR)-599-mediated androgen receptor (AR) suppression by acting as a sponge for miR-599. Rescue assays indicated that circ-ASPH facilitated cell progression by regulating AR expression. Moreover, AR activated long non-coding RNA suppressor of cytokine signaling 2-anti- sense RNA 1 (SOCS2-AS1) expression in GM cells. Taken together, circ-ASPH/miR-599/AR/SOCS2-AS1 signaling may be a promising biomarker/therapeutic target for GM. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.","Circ-ASPH;

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of non-coding RNAs generated by covalently closed loops through back-splicing. As an emerging research hotspot, circR-NAs have attracted considerable attention due to their high conservation, stability, abundance, and specificity of tissue development. Accumulating evidence has revealed different form of circRNAs are closely related to the malignant phenotype, prognosis and chemotherapy resistance of BC, suggesting that different circRNAs may be promising biomarkers and have therapeutic significance in BC. The intention of this review is to summarize the mechanisms of circRNA-mediated BC progression and their diagnostic and prognostic value as biomarkers, as well as to further explore their roles in chemotherapy resistance. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is time-consuming and expensive to determine the circRNA-disease associations through experimental methods. Therefore, based on the existing databases, we propose a method named RWRKNN, which integrates the random walk with restart (RWR) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to predict the associations between circRNAs and diseases. Specifically, we apply RWR algorithm on weighting features with global network topology information, and employ KNN to classify based on features. Finally, the prediction scores of each circRNA-disease pair are obtained. As demonstrated by leave-one-out, 5-fold cross-validation and 10-fold cross-validation, RWRKNN achieves AUC values of 0.9297, 0.9333 and 0.9261, respectively. And case studies show that the circRNA-disease associations predicted by RWRKNN can be successfully demonstrated. In conclusion, RWRKNN is a useful method for predicting circRNA-disease associations. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; RNA, Circular; algorithm; biology; cluster analysis; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; procedures","","RNA, Circular, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund, NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund, (61672334, 61902230, 61972451); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (GK201901010)","We thank the financial support which comes from National Natural Science Foundation of China (61672334, 61972451, 61902230) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. GK201901010).","Fan X., Et al., Circular RNAs in Cardiovascular Disease: An Overview, BioMed research international, 2017, (2017); Greene J., Et al., Circular RNAs: Biogenesis, Function and Role in Human, Diseases.

While studies have shown that ncRNAs are extremely diverse and ubiquitous, the functions of the vast majority of ncRNAs are still unknown. With ever-increasing ncRNAs under study, it is essential to identify, categorize and annotate these ncRNAs on a genome-wide scale. The use of high-Throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies provides a broader picture of the non-coding component of transcriptome, enabling the comprehensive identification and annotation of all major ncRNAs across samples. However, the detection of known and emerging class of ncRNAs from RNA-seq data demands complex computational methods owing to their unique as well as similar characteristics. Here, we discuss major plant endogenous, regulatory ncRNAs in an RNA sample followed by computational strategies applied to discover each class of ncRNAs using RNA-seq. We also provide a collection of relevant software packages and databases to present a comprehensive bioinformatics toolbox for plant ncRNA researchers. We assume that the discussions in this review will provide a rationale for the discovery of all major categories of plant ncRNAs. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) may function as the decoys for microRNAs (miRNAs) or proteins, the templates for translation, and the sources of pseudogene generation. The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic circRNAs, which are related to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), that adsorb miRNAs on the basis of the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis. Methods. The differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) in LUAD were revealed by the microarray data (GSE101586 and GSE101684) that were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The miRNAs that were targeted by the DEcircRNAs were predicted with the CircInteractome, and the target mRNAs of the miRNAs were found by the miRDB and the TargetScan. The ceRNA network was built by the Cytoscape. The potential biological roles and the regulatory mechanisms of the circRNAs were investigated by the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The expression of the host genes of circRNAs was examined by the Ualcan. The survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Results. In comparison with normal lung tissues, LUAD tissues contained 7 overlapping cancer-specific DEcircRNAs with 294 miRNA response elements (MREs). Among the 7 DEcircRNAs, 3 circRNAs (hsa_circ_0072088, hsa_circ_0003528, and hsa_circ_0008274) were upregulated and 4 circRNAs (hsa_circ_0003162, hsa_circ_0029426, hsa_circ_0049271, and hsa_circ_0043256) were downregulated. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, which included 33 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 2007 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), was constructed. These mRNAs were enriched in the biological function of cell-cell adhesion, response to hypoxia, and stem cell differentiation and were involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling, HIF-1 signaling, and cAMP signaling pathways. Conclusion. Our results indicated that 7 DEcircRNAs could have diagnostic value for LUAD. Additionally, the circRNAs-mediated ceRNA network might provide a novel perspective into unraveling the pathogenesis and progression of LUAD.  © 2021 Yuechao Liu et al.","","circular ribonucleic acid;

Increasing numbers of circRNAs are being identified in plants and animals, and recent studies have shown that circRNAs play an important role in gene regulation. Therefore, identifying circRNAs from increasing amounts of RNA-seq data is very important. However, traditional circRNA recognition methods have limitations. In recent years, emerging machine learning techniques have provided a good approach for the identification of circRNAs in animals. However, using these features to identify plant circRNAs is infeasible because the characteristics of plant circRNA sequences are different from those of animal circRNAs. For example, plants are extremely rich in splicing signals and transposable elements, and their sequence conservation in rice, for example is far less than that in mammals. To solve these problems and better identify circRNAs in plants, it is urgent to develop circRNA recognition software using machine learning based on the characteristics of plant circRNAs. Results: In this study, we built a software program named PCirc using a machine learning method to predict plant circRNAs from RNA-seq data. First, we extracted different features, including open reading frames, numbers of k-mers, and splicing junction sequence coding, from rice circRNA and lncRNA data. Second, we trained a machine learning model by the random forest algorithm with tenfold cross-validation in the training set. Third, we evaluated our classification according to accuracy, precision, and F1 score, and all scores on the model test data were above 0.99. Fourth, we tested our model by other plant tests, and obtained good results, with accuracy scores above 0.8. Finally, we packaged the machine learning model built and the programming script used into a locally run circular RNA prediction software, Pcirc (https://github.com/Lilab-SNNU/Pcirc). Conclusion: Based on rice circRNA and lncRNA data, a machine learning model for plant circRNA recognition was constructed in this study using random forest algorithm, and the model can also be applied to plant circRNA recognition such as Arabidopsis thaliana and maize. At the same time, after the completion of model construction, the machine learning model constructed and the programming scripts used in this study are packaged into a localized circRNA prediction software Pcirc, which is convenient for plant circRNA researchers to use. © 2021, The Author(s).","CircRNA; Machine learning; Plant; Random forest","Computational Biology; Machine Learning; Plants; RNA, Circular; Software; Decision trees; Forecasting; Mammals; Random forests; RNA; Turing machines; Arabidopsis thaliana; Closed-loop structures; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Random forest algorithm; Sequence conservation; Transposable elements; biology; genetics; machine learning; plant; procedures; software; Machine learning","","RNA, Circular, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11631012, 31370329, 31770333); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University, NCET, (NCET-12-0896); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (GK201403004)","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers 31770333, 31370329, and 11631012), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-12-0896), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. GK201403004), and all the entity had no roles in the design of this software, collection, analysis and interpretation of data, nor in writing the manuscript.

Although originally assumed as non-coding RNAs, recent studies have evidenced that animal circRNAs can act as translatable transcripts. The study of plant-circRNAs is incipient, and no autonomous coding plant-circRNA has been described yet. Viroids are the smallest plant-pathogenic circRNAs known to date. Since their discovery 50 years ago, viroids have been considered valuable systems for the study of the structure-function relationships in RNA, essentially because they have not been shown to have coding capacity. We used two pathogenic circRNAs (Hop stunt viroid and Eggplant latent viroid) as experimental tools to explore the coding potential of plant-circRNAs. Our work supports that the analysed viroids contain putative ORFs able to encode peptides carrying subcellular localization signals coincident with the corresponding replication-specific organelle. Bioassays in well-established hosts revealed that mutations in these ORFs diminish their biological efficiency. Interestingly, circular forms of HSVd and ELVd were found to co-sediment with polysomes, revealing their physical interaction with the translational machinery of the plant cell. Based on this evidence we hypothesize about the possibility that plant circRNAs in general, and viroids in particular, can act, under certain cellular conditions, as non-canonical translatable transcripts. © 2021 The Author(s).

Circular ribonucleic acids (circRNAs) participate in autoimmune diseases, but the roles of circRNAs in T1D with CDAbs are currently unknown. This study aimed to determine the frequency of CDAbs in Chinese children with T1D and describe the relationship between CDAbs and circRNAs. Materials and methods: Eighty patients diagnosed with T1D were screened for CDAbs and CD-predisposing genes, and circRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 47 patients. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was searched for candidate circRNAs in related studies on T1D PBMCs. Data on clinical characteristics (i.e., blood glucose control, residual islet function, and daily insulin dosage) and immunophenotypes (i.e., islet autoantibodies and immune cell subsets) were collected. Results: In total, 35.0% of patients were positive for CDAbs. CD-predisposing genes accounted for 52.5% of the genes, and no significant difference in frequency was found between the CDAb-positive (CDAb+) and CDAb-negative (CDAb–) groups. In addition, among the differentially expressed circRNAs from the GEO database, five highly conserved circRNAs homologous to humans and mice were screened, and only the expression of hsa_circ_0004564 in the CDAb+ group significantly decreased (CDAb+ vs. CDAb–:1.72 ± 1.92 vs. 11.12 ± 8.59, p = 6.0 × 10–6), while the expression of hsa_circ_0004564 was upregulated in the general T1D population. Moreover, its parental gene RAPH1 was significantly upregulated (CDAb+ vs. CDAb–:1.26 ± 0.99 vs. 0.61 ± 0.46, p = 0.011). Importantly, the positive correlation between hsa_circ_0004564 and CD3+ cells was validated in children with T1D after adjustments for CDAbs (p = 0.029), while there were no correlations between hsa_circ_0004564 and clinical characteristics or other immune cell subsets (i.e., CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells). Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of screening for CD in Chinese children with T1D, considering the high prevalence of CDAb positivity and CD-predisposing genes. The profile of candidate circRNAs in children with T1D with CDAbs was different from that in previous reports on general T1D patients from the GEO database. Moreover, hsa_circ_0004564 and its parental gene RAPH1 may be new targets for studying immune mechanisms in children with T1D and CD.

These circular molecules were discovered more than 40 years ago but failed to raise scientific interest until lately. Increasing studies have found that these circular RNAs might not just be byproducts of the splicing process but possess important regulatory functions through different cellular events. Most circular RNAs are currently being studied in the field of cancer, and many of them have been confirmed to be involved in the process of tumorigenesis. However, many circular RNAs are implicated in the developmental stages of diseases other than cancer. In this review, we focus on discussing the role of circular RNAs in non-cancer diseases, especially in cardiovascular diseases. Following the summary of the life cycle of circRNAs, we provide input on studying circRNA-protein interactions based on our experience, which modulate protein translocation. Furthermore, we outline the potential of circRNAs to be potent biomarkers, effective therapeutic targets, and potential treatments in cardiovascular diseases as well as other non-cancer fields. © 2021 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy","biomarker; cardiovascular; circRNAs; circular RNAs; therapeutic; translocation","Cardiovascular Diseases; Early Diagnosis; Genetic Markers; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Protein Transport; Proteins; RNA, Circular; biological marker; circular ribonucleic acid; protein; biogenesis; cardiovascular disease; cellular distribution; central nervous system disease; diabetes mellitus; disease marker; gene expression; gene function; gene location; gene targeting; genetic database; hematologic disease; human; immunopathology; life cycle; musculoskeletal disease; nonhuman; protein RNA binding; protein transport; respiratory tract disease; Review; RNA degradation; RNA translation; RNA transport; cardiovascular disease; early diagnosis; genetic marker; genetics; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy","","protein, 67254-75-5; Genetic Markers, ; Proteins, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (PJT-153105, PJT-155962, PJT-166107); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201807980003, 201906175051)","This work supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( PJT-153105 , PJT-155962 , and PJT-166107 to B.B.Y.).

In modern society, age estimation is essential in a large variety of legal rights and duties. Accumulating evidence suggests roles for microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in regulating numerous processes during aging. Here, we performed circRNA sequencing in two age groups and analyzed microarray data of 171 healthy subjects (17–104 years old) downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases with integrated bioinformatics methods. A total of 1,403 circular RNAs were differentially expressed between young and old groups, and 141 circular RNAs were expressed exclusively in elderly samples while 10 circular RNAs were expressed only in young subjects. Based on their expression pattern in these two groups, the circular RNAs were categorized into three classes: age-related expression between young and old, age-limited expression-young only, and age-limited expression-old only. Top five expressed circular RNAs among three classes and a total of 18 differentially expressed microRNAs screened from online databases were selected to validate using RT-qPCR tests. An independent set of 200 blood samples (20–80 years old) was used to develop age prediction models based on 15 age-related noncoding RNAs (11 microRNAs and 4 circular RNAs). Different machine learning algorithms for age prediction were applied, including regression tree, bagging, support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), and XGBoost. Among them, random forest regression model performed best in both training set (mean absolute error = 3.68 years, r = 0.96) and testing set (MAE = 6.840 years, r = 0.77). Models using one single type of predictors, circular RNAs-only or microRNAs-only, result in bigger errors. Smaller prediction errors were shown in males than females when constructing models according to different-sex separately. Putative microRNA targets (430 genes) were enriched in the cellular senescence pathway and cell homeostasis and cell differentiation regulation, indirectly indicating that the microRNAs screened in our study were correlated with development and aging. This study demonstrates that the noncoding RNA aging clock has potential in predicting chronological age and will be an available biological marker in routine forensic investigation to predict the age of biological samples.

The study of circRNA functions depends on the full-length sequences of circRNA, and current sequence assembly methods based on short reads face challenges due to the existence of linear transcript. Long reads produced by long-read sequencing techniques such as Nanopore technology can cover full-length sequences of circRNA and therefore can be used to evaluate the correctness and completeness of circRNA full sequences assembled from short reads of the same sample. Using long reads of the same samples, one from human and the other from mouse, we have comprehensively evaluated the performance of several well-known circRNA sequence assembly algorithms based on short reads, including circseq_cup, CIRI_full, and CircAST. Based on the F1 score, the performance of CIRI-full was better in human datasets, whereas in mouse datasets CircAST was better. In general, each algorithm was developed to handle special situations or circumstances. Our results indicated that no single assembly algorithm generated better performance in all cases. Therefore, these assembly algorithms should be used together for reliable full-length circRNA sequence reconstruction. After analyzing the results, we have introduced a screening protocol that selects out exonic circRNAs with full-length sequences consisting of all exons between back splice sites as the final result. After screening, CIRI-full showed better performance for both human and mouse datasets. The average F1 score of CIRI-full over four circRNA identification algorithms increased from 0.4788 to 0.5069 in human datasets, and it increased from 0.2995 to 0.4223 in mouse datasets.

Noncoding RNAs had been confirmed to have crucial roles in human diseases. So far, there were few systematical and comprehensive studies towards the expression profile of RNAs in the brain after hypoxia ischemia. In this study, 31 differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) with upregulation were identified. In addition, 5512 differentially expressed mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) were identified in HIE groups. Bioinformatics analysis showed these circRNAs and mRNAs were significantly enriched in regulation of leukocyte activation, response to virus, and neutrophil degranulation. Pathway and its related gene network analysis indicated that HLA - DPA1, HLA - DQA2, HLA - DQB1, and HLA - DRB4 have a more crucial role in HIE. Finally, miRNA-circRNA-mRNA interaction network analysis was also performed to identify hub miRNAs and circRNAs. We found that miR-592 potentially targeting 5 circRNAs, thus affecting 15 mRNA expressions in HIR. hsa_circ_0068397 and hsa_circ_0045698 were identified as hub circRNAs in HIE. Collectively, using RNA-seq, bioinformatics analysis, and circRNA/miRNA interaction prediction, we systematically investigated the differentially expressed RNAs in HIE, which could give a new hint of understanding the pathogenesis of HIE. © 2021 Lin Wei et al.","","Computational Biology;

They are widely present in all eukaryotes and are very stable. Currently, circRNA studies have become a hotspot in RNA research. It has been reported that circRNAs constitute a significant proportion of transcript expression, and some are significantly more abundantly expressed than other transcripts. CircRNAs have regulatory roles in gene expression and critical biological functions in the development of organisms, such as acting as microRNA sponges or as endogenous RNAs and biomarkers. As such, they may have useful functions in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. CircRNAs have been found to play an important role in the development of several diseases, including atherosclerosis, neurological disorders, diabetes, and cancer. In this paper, we review the status of circRNA research, describe circRNA-related databases and the identification of circRNAs, discuss the role of circRNAs in human diseases such as colon cancer, atherosclerosis, and gastric cancer, and identify remaining research questions related to circRNAs. © Copyright © 2021 Jiao, Wu, Huang, Liu and Gao.","circRNAs; circRNAs identification; database; diseases; machine learning","circular ribonucleic acid; messenger RNA; untranslated RNA; 3' untranslated region; atherosclerosis; bioinformatics; breast cancer; colon cancer; cyclization; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; exosome; genetic marker; high throughput sequencing; human; liver cell carcinoma; machine learning; neurologic disease; receiver operating characteristic; Review; RNA splicing; sensitivity and specificity; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; stomach cancer; support vector machine; transcriptomics; tumor suppressor gene","","","","","Edanz Editing China; Liwen Bianji; Louise Adam; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62002087)","Funding text 1: We thank Louise Adam, ELS(D), from Liwen Bianji, Edanz Editing China (www.liwenbianji.cn/ac), for editing the English text of a draft of this manuscript.

However, it is time-consuming and costly to merely conduct biological experiments to detect the association between circRNA and diseases. Accordingly, developing an efficient computational model to predict circRNA-disease associations is urgent. Methods: In this research, we propose a multiple heterogeneous networks-based method, named XGBCDA, to predict circRNA-disease associations. The method first extracts original features, namely statistical features and graph theory features, from integrated circRNA similarity network, disease similarity network and circRNA-disease association network, and then sends these original features to the XGBoost classifier for training latent features. The method utilizes the tree learned by the XGBoost model, the index of leaf that instance finally falls into, and the 1 of K coding to represent the latent features. Finally, the method combines the latent features from the XGBoost with the original features to train the final model for predicting the association between the circRNA and diseases. Results: The tenfold cross-validation results of the XGBCDA method illustrate that the area under the ROC curve reaches 0.9860. In addition, the method presents a striking performance in the case studies of colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and cervical cancer. Conclusion: With fabulous performance in predicting potential circRNA-disease associations, the XGBCDA method has the promising ability to assist biomedical researchers in terms of circRNA-disease association prediction. © 2021, The Author(s).","Association prediction; circRNA; XGBoost","Computational Biology; Humans; Research Design; RNA, Circular; ROC Curve; Stomach Neoplasms; circular ribonucleic acid; Article; biomedicine; case study; classifier; colorectal cancer; comparative study; controlled study; cross validation; disease association; human; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; scientist; stomach cancer; uterine cervix cancer; XGBCDA method; biology; genetics; methodology; procedures; stomach tumor","","RNA, Circular, ","","","Experimental Center of School of Computer Science and Engineering of Central South University; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61672541, 61972422)","Funding text 1: The authors are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments which have helped significantly in revising this work.

Methods: This study aims to investigate the expression profiles of circRNAs by RNA sequencing and RT–PCR in a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify the potential functions of circRNA host genes. Machine learning classification models were used to assess circRNAs as potential biomarkers of ICH. Results: A total of 125 and 284 differentially expressed circRNAs (fold change > 1.5 and FDR < 0.05) were found between ICH patients and healthy controls in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. Nine circRNAs were consistently altered in ICH patients compared to healthy controls. The combination of the novel circERBB2 and circCHST12 in ICH patients and healthy controls showed an area under the curve of 0.917 (95% CI: 0.869–0.965), with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 82%. In combination with ICH risk factors, circRNAs improved the performance in discriminating ICH patients from healthy controls. Together with hsa_circ_0005505, two novel circRNAs for differentiating between patients with ICH and healthy controls showed an AUC of 0.946 (95% CI: 0.910–0.982), with a sensitivity of 89.1% and a specificity of 86%. Conclusion: We provided a transcriptome-wide overview of aberrantly expressed circRNAs in ICH patients and identified hsa_circ_0005505 and novel circERBB2 and circCHST12 as potential biomarkers for diagnosing ICH.

Recent advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools have led directly to an ever-expanding field of types and biological functions of circRNAs. In parallel with technological developments, practical applications of circRNAs have arisen including their utilization as biomarkers of human disease. Currently, circRNA-associated bioinformatics tools can support projects including circRNA annotation, circRNA identification and network analysis of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). In this review, we collected about 100 circRNA-associated bioinformatics tools and summarized their current attributes and capabilities. We also performed network analysis and text mining on circRNA tool publications in order to reveal trends in their ongoing development.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Bioinformatics tools; CircRNA; Disease biomarker;

Increasing evidence shows that circular RNAs can directly bind to RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and play an important role in a variety of biological activities. The interactions between circRNAs and RBPs are key to comprehending the mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation. Accurately identifying binding sites is very useful for analyzing interactions. In past research, some predictors on the basis of machine learning (ML) have been presented, but prediction accuracy still needs to be ameliorated. Therefore, we present a novel calculation model, CRBPDL, which uses an Adaboost integrated deep hierarchical network to identify the binding sites of circular RNA-RBP. CRBPDL combines five different feature encoding schemes to encode the original RNA sequence, uses deep multiscale residual networks (MSRN) and bidirectional gating recurrent units (BiGRUs) to effectively learn high-level feature representations, it is sufficient to extract local and global context information at the same time. Additionally, a self-attention mechanism is employed to train the robustness of the CRBPDL. Ultimately, the Adaboost algorithm is applied to integrate deep learning (DL) model to improve prediction performance and reliability of the model. To verify the usefulness of CRBPDL, we compared the efficiency with state-of-the-art methods on 37 circular RNA data sets and 31 linear RNA data sets. Moreover, results display that CRBPDL is capable of performing universal, reliable, and robust. The code and data sets are obtainable at https://github.com/nmt315320/ CRBPDL.git.  © 2022 Niu et al.

With the continuous advancement of high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools, many circRNAs have been identified in various human tissues and cell lines. Notably, recent studies have indicated that some circRNAs have translational functions. Internal ribosome entry sites and the N6-methyladenosine modification mediate cap-independent translation. This review describes these two translation mechanisms and verification methods at the molecular level. Databases (including ORF Finder, Pfam, BLASTp, CircRNADb, CircBase, CircPro, CircCode, IRESite, IRESbase) were used to analyze whether circRNAs have the structural characteristic of translation. CircRNA minigene reporter system containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) confirmed the translation potential of circRNAs. Also, we briefly summarize the roles of proteins/peptides encoded by circRNAs (circFBXW7, circFNDC3B, circLgr4, circPPP1R12A, circMAPK1, circβ-catenin, circGprc5a, circ-SHPRH, circPINTexon2, circAKT3) that have been verified thus far in human cancers (triple-negative breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, bladder cancer, glioblastoma). Those findings suggest circRNAs have a great implication in translation of the human genome. © 2021 The Authors.

Five years ago, we developed a comprehensive plant circRNA database (PlantcircBase), which has attracted much attention from the plant circRNA community. Here, we report an updated PlantcircBase (v.7.0), which contains 171,118 circRNAs from 21 plant species. Over 31,000 of the circRNAs have full-length sequences constructed based on analysis of 749 bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets downloaded from the public domain and Nanopore long-read sequencing results of rice RNAs newly generated in this study. A plant multiple conservation score (PMCS), based on the conservation of both sequence and expression profiles, was calculated for each circRNA to quantify and compare the conservation of all circRNAs. A new parameter, plant circRNA confidence level (PCCL), is introduced to measure the identity reliability of each circRNA based on experimental validation results and the number of references that support the circRNA. All this information and other details of circRNAs can be browsed, searched, and downloaded from PlantcircBase 7.0, which also provides online bioinformatics tools for visualization and sequence alignment.

The function of such regulatory RNAs is largely dependent on their subcellular localization. Several circRNAs have been shown to conduct antagonistic roles compared to the products of the linear isoforms, and thus need to be characterized distinctly from the linear RNAs. However, conventional fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques cannot be employed directly to distinguish the signals from linear and circular isoforms because most circRNAs share the same sequence with the linear RNAs. In order to address this unmet need, we adapted the well-established method of single-molecule FISH by designing two sets of probes to differentiate the linear and circular RNA isoforms by virtue of signal colocalization. We call this method ‘circular fluorescent in situ hybridization’ (circFISH). Linear and circular RNAs were successfully visualized and quantified at a single-molecule resolution in fixed cells. RNase R treatment during the circFISH reduced the levels of linear RNAs while the circRNA levels remain unaltered. Furthermore, cells with shRNAs specific to circRNA showed the loss of circRNA levels, whereas the linear RNA levels were unaffected. The optimization of the in-situ RNase R treatment allowed the multiplexing of circFISH to combine it with organelle staining. CircFISH was found to be compatible with multiple sample types, including cultured cells and fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed tissue sections. Thus, we present circFISH as a versatile method for the simultaneous visualization and quantification of the distribution and localization of linear and circular RNA in fixed cells and tissue samples. © 2022 by the authors.

Dysregulation of circRNA expression can drive cancer development and progression with different mechanisms. CircRNAs are currently regarded as extremely attractive molecules in cancer research for the identification of new and possibly targetable disease regulatory networks and for the development of biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis definition, and monitoring. Using specific experimental and computational protocols, circRNAs can be identified through RNA-seq by spotting the reads spanning backsplice junctions, which are specific to circular molecules. In this chapter, we report a state-of-the-art computational protocol for a genome-wide analysis of circRNAs from RNA-seq data, which considers circRNA detection, quantification, and differential expression testing. Finally, we indicate how to determine circular transcript sequences and the resources for an in silico functional characterization of circRNAs. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bioinformatics;

The genetic and epigenetic molecular alterations of TC have become more evident in recent years. However, a deeper understanding of the roles these molecular changes play in TC tumorigenesis and progression is essential in developing a successful treatment strategy and improving patients’ prognoses. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a family of non-coding RNAs, have been implicated in several aspects of carcinogenesis in multiple cancers, including TC. In the current review, we aimed to explore the clinical potential of circRNAs as putative diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets in TC. The current analyses, including genome-wide circRNA screening and functional enrichment for all deregulated circRNA expression signatures, show that circRNAs display atypical contributions, such as sponging for microRNAs, regulating transcription and translation processes, and decoying for proteins. Given their exceptional clinical advantages, such as higher stability, wider abundance, and occurrence in several body fluids, circRNAs are promising prognostic and theranostic biomarkers for TC. © 2022 by the authors.","circRNA; circular RNAs; diagnosis; exosomal circRNAs; functional enrichment analysis; genome-wide circRNAs; online databases; prognosis; treatment resistance","biological marker; circular ribonucleic acid; transcription factor; transforming growth factor alpha; autophagy (cellular); biogenesis; biological activity; cancer prognosis; carcinogenesis; chemotherapy; computer model; data base; differential gene expression; DNA microarray; downstream processing; epigenetics; functional enrichment analysis; gene overexpression; genetic transcription; genome-wide association study; human; mRNA expression assay; nuclear export; online database; pathway enrichment analysis; Review; sponge (Porifera); thyroid cancer; tumor growth; turnover rate; upregulation","","","","","Tulane University","This work was supported by a research grant (THYROIDGRANT2021-0000000232) from “Bite Me Cancer” and facilitated by the “American Thyroid Association” (to E.T.) and “Tulane University Bridge Fund” (to E.K.).","Cabanillas M.E., McFadden D.G., Durante C., Thyroid cancer, Lancet, 388, pp. 2783-2795, (2016); Kitahara C.M., Sosa J.A., The changing incidence of thyroid cancer, Nat.

ACI is caused by blood flow disruption, leading to high disability and mortality rates. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is critical toward developing effective therapeutic approaches. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an important class of non-coding RNAs, which have been implicated in several molecular pathways, and their dysregulation has been described in several disease conditions. Here, we set out to explore the possible regulatory role of circRNAs in ischemic stroke and study their molecular function in disease. First, we applied high-throughput sequencing techniques to identify the differential changes of plasma circRNAs expression in patients with acute cerebral infarction. Next, we used GO and KEGG pathway analysis to predict the function of differentially expressed circRNAs. Moreover, we have assessed the possible interaction between the identified differentially expressed circRNAs and miRNAs. Finally, we have selected and validated five downregulated circRNAs by RT-qPCR. Together, the results of this study provide evidence that circRNAs are potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of cerebral infarction and have to be considered as targets for drug treatment. © 2021 The Author(s).

More and more biological experiments show that circRNA plays important roles in many diseases by regulating the target genes of miRNA. Therefore, correct identification of the potential interaction between circRNA and miRNA not only helps to understand the mechanism of the disease, but also contributes to the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the disease. In this study, we propose a model (IIMCCMA) by using network embedding and matrix completion to predict the potential interaction of circRNA-miRNA. Firstly, the corresponding adjacency matrix is constructed based on the experimentally verified circRNA-miRNA interaction, circRNA-cancer interaction, and miRNA-cancer interaction. Then, the Gaussian kernel function and the cosine function are used to calculate the circRNA Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, circRNA functional similarity, miRNA Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, and miRNA functional similarity. In order to reduce the influence of noise and redundant information in known interactions, this model uses network embedding to extract the potential feature vectors of circRNA and miRNA, respectively. Finally, an improved inductive matrix completion algorithm based on the feature vectors of circRNA and miRNA is used to identify potential interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs. The 10-fold cross-validation experiment is utilized to prove the predictive ability of the IIMCCMA. The experimental results show that the AUC value and AUPR value of the IIMCCMA model are higher than other state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, case studies show that the IIMCCMA model can correctly identify the potential interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs.

Protein-coding mRNAs, as well as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long ncRNA (lncRNA), circular RNA (circRNA), and microRNA (miRNA), have been demonstrated to play an essential role in the regulation of cancer biology. However, the comprehensive expression profile and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network between mRNAs and ncRNAs in the OS chemo-resistance still remain unclear. In the current study, we developed whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) in the three paired multi-drug chemo-resistant and chemo-sensitive OS cell lines to comprehensively identify differentially expressed lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed for mRNAs with significantly different expression. Then the ceRNA networks combining lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were predicted and constructed on the basis of the authoritative miRanda and TargetScan databases combined with the widely accepted vital drug resistance-related genes and signal transduction pathways. In addition, two constructed ceRNA regulatory pathways, lncRNAMEG3/hsa-miR-200b-3p/AKT2 and hsa_circ_0001258/hsa-miR-744-3p/GSTM2, were randomly selected and validated by real-time qPCR, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down assay, and dual luciferase reporter gene system. Taken together, our findings may provide new evidence for the underlying mechanism of OS chemo-resistance and uncover some novel targets for reversing it. Zhang et al. identify the comprehensive expression profile and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network between mRNAs and ncRNAs (long ncRNA [lncRNA], circular RNA (circRNA), and microRNA [miRNA]) in the OS chemo-resistance by whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and assay validation in the three paired multi-drug chemo-resistant and chemo-sensitive OS cell lines. © 2019 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy","ceRNA; chemo-resistance; mRNA; ncRNA; osteosarcoma","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Computational Biology; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Ontology; Humans; Immunoprecipitation; Male; MicroRNAs; Osteosarcoma; RNA, Circular; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; Young Adult; circular RNA; cisplatin; competing endogenous RNA; doxorubicin; glutathione transferase M2; hsa circ 0001258; hsa miR 200b 3p; hsa miR 744 3p; ifosfamide; lncRNAMEG3; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; methotrexate; microRNA; protein kinase B beta; RNA; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; adolescent; adult; Article; child; drug response; drug sensitivity; female; gene expression; genetic database; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoprecipitation; interactions with RNA; luciferase assay; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; osteosarcoma; osteosarcoma cell line; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; signal transduction; biology; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; gene ontology; genetics; metabolism; osteosarcoma; physiology; young adult","","cisplatin, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; ifosfamide, 3778-73-2; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; RNA, 63231-63-0; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, Circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ; RNA, Messenger, ","","","Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical-Engineering Cross Research Fund, (YG2012MS49); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81572630, 81872174); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (13PJD023); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (22120170216)","This project was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81572630 and 81872174 ), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 22120170216 ), the Shanghai Pujiang Program of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission ( 13PJD023 ), and Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical-Engineering Cross Research Fund ( YG2012MS49 ).

For specific cancers, proteins encoded by fusion transcripts have been identified as innovative therapeutic targets (e.g., EML4-ALK). Even though RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies combined with existing bioinformatics approaches have enabled researchers to systematically identify fusion transcripts, specifically detecting f-circRNAs in cells remains challenging owing to their general sparsity and low abundance in cancer cells but also owing to imperfect computational methods. Results: We developed the Python-based workflow ""Fcirc""to identify fusion linear and f-circRNAs from RNA-Seq data with high specificity. We applied Fcirc to 3 different types of RNA-Seq data scenarios: (i) actual synthetic spike-in RNA-Seq data, (ii) simulated RNA-Seq data, and (iii) actual cancer cell-derived RNA-Seq data. Fcirc showed significant advantages over existing methods regarding both detection accuracy (i.e., precision, recall, F-measure) and computing performance (i.e., lower runtimes). Conclusion: Fcirc is a powerful and comprehensive Python-based pipeline to identify linear and circular RNA transcripts from known fusion events in RNA-Seq datasets with higher accuracy and shorter computing times compared with previously published algorithms. Fcirc empowers the research community to study the biology of fusion RNAs in cancer more effectively. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)metastasis remains largely unknown. Herein, we enrolled three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)databases and screened and identified a novel circRNA, circ-ZNF652 (hsa_circ_0003258), which was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Importantly, HCC patients with high circ-ZNF652 expression were more prone to vascular invasion, intrahepatic metastasis, distant metastasis, and poor outcome. Subsequent functional experiments showed that depletion of circ-ZNF652 dramatically suppressed the migratory and invasive capabilities of HCC cells in vitro as well as tumor metastasis in vivo by inhibiting the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, circ-ZNF652 could physically interact with miR-203 and miR-502-5p to increase the expression of their common target gene Snail (a key transcription factor that triggers EMT), thereby promoting the metastasis of HCC. In turn, the upregulated Snail was capable of binding to the E-box motif (CAGGTG)on the promoter of circ-ZNF652 to elevate circ-ZNF652 expression. Collectively, our findings suggest that circ-ZNF652 is a novel driver of EMT and unveil the important regulatory role of circ-ZNF652/miR-203/miR-502-5p/Snail feedback loop in HCC metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Circular RNA; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Metastasis; microRNA","circular RNA ZNF652; microRNA; microRNA 203; microRNA 502; RNA; transcription factor Snail; unclassified drug; adult; Article; clinical outcome; controlled study; depletion; distant metastasis; E box element; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene; gene expression; genetic database; genetic screening; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; liver metastasis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; promoter region; protein binding; Snail gene; tumor invasion; upregulation","","RNA, 63231-63-0","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81572425)","This project was supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No. 81572425 .

Various indications specify that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are plentiful in the human transcriptome. However, their participation in biological processes remains mostly undescribed. To date thousands of circRNAs have been revealed in organisms ranging from Drosophila melanogaster to Homo sapiens. Functional studies specify that these transcripts control expression of protein-coding linear transcripts and thus encompass a key component of gene expression regulation. This chapter provide a comprehensive overview on functional validation of circRNAs. Furthermore, we discuss the recent modern methodologies for the functional validation of circRNAs such as RNA interference (RNAi) gene silencing assay, luciferase reporter assays, circRNA gain-of-function investigation via overexpression of circular transcript assay, RT-q-PCR quantification, and other latest applicable assays. The methods described in this chapter are demonstrated on the cellular model. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Cellular model; CircRNAs; Functional validation","Alternative Splicing; Animals;

Various experiments reveled that they are covalently closed molecules and are resistant to attack by exonucleases. These RNA molecules are linked to various diseases. Interestingly, though they belong to the class of non-coding RNAs, some of them are experimentally verified to code for protein products. Till date there are no reports regarding the structural aspects of the protein products from these circular RNA molecules. In this work, an attempt has been made to analyze the structural details of the proteins obtained from the circular RNA molecules. Only those circular RNAs were selected for which there was direct experimental evidences of generation of protein products. The work for the first time elucidates the molecular details of the protein products obtained from circular RNA molecules. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Circular RNA; Long non-coding RNA; Molecular mechanism; Protein coding; Structural details","Databases, Genetic; Gene Ontology; Glioblastoma; Humans; Leukemia; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Oligodendroglioma; Open Reading Frames; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA; RNA, Long Noncoding; circular RNA; RNA; unclassified drug; long untranslated RNA; RNA; RNA, circular; amino acid sequence; Article; gene product; genetic code; human; molecular mechanics; priority journal; protein structure; classification; gene ontology; genetic database; genetics; glioblastoma; leukemia; metabolism; molecular genetics; oligodendroglioma; open reading frame; pathology; protein synthesis","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ","","","Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology, DBT; Indian Council of Medical Research, ICMR, (BIC/12(02)/2014); University of Kalyani, UoK; Department of Biotechnology, Government of West Bengal, DBT-WB; of India, (102/IFD/ SAN/1824/2015-2016)","Funding text 1: The author acknowledge University of Kalyani, Kalyani (W.B.)

Cells that are deprived of adequate oxygen supply trigger transcriptional and post-transcriptional responses, which control cellular pathways such as angiogenesis, proliferation, and metabolic adaptation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of mainly non-coding RNAs, which have been implicated in multiple cancers and attract increasing attention as potential biomarkers. Here, we characterize the circRNA signatures of three different cancer cell lines from cervical (HeLa), breast (MCF-7), and lung (A549) cancer under hypoxia. In order to reliably detect circRNAs, we integrate available tools with custom approaches for quantification and statistical analysis. Using this consolidated computational pipeline, we identify ~12000 circRNAs in the three cancer cell lines. Their molecular characteristics point to an involvement of complementary RNA sequences as well as trans-acting factors in circRNA biogenesis, such as the RNA-binding protein HNRNPC. Notably, we detect a number of circRNAs that are more abundant than their linear counterparts. In addition, 64 circRNAs significantly change in abundance upon hypoxia, in most cases in a cell type-specific manner. In summary, we present a comparative circRNA profiling in human cancer cell lines, which promises novel insights into the biogenesis and function of circRNAs under hypoxic stress. © 2019 The Author(s) (2019).

Growing evidence suggests that circRNAs play a pivotal role in the progression of malignant diseases. However, the expression profiles and function of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. We investigated the expression of microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase 1 (MAST1) circRNA (circMAST1) in HCC and healthy tissues using bioinformatics, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess the interaction between circMAST1 and miR-1299. Proliferation assays, colony formation assays, flow cytometry, transwell assays, and western blotting were also performed. A mouse xenograft model was also used to determine the effect of circMAST1 on HCC growth in vivo. CircMAST1 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines; silencing via small interfering RNA inhibited migration, invasion, and proliferation of HCC cell lines in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, the expression of circMAST1 was positively correlated with catenin delta-1 (CTNND1) and negatively correlated with microRNA (miR)-1299 in HCC clinical samples. Importantly, circMAST1 sponged miR-1299 to stabilize the expression of CTNND1 and promoted tumorigenic features in HCC cell lines. We found that circMAST1 may serve as a novel biomarker for HCC. Moreover, circMAST1 elicits HCC progression by sponging miRNA-1299 and stabilizing CTNND1. Our data provide potential options for therapeutic targets in patients with HCC. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Catenins; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Databases, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; RNA, Circular; Signal Transduction; Tumor Burden; catenin; catenin delta 1; circular ribonucleic acid; microRNA; microrna 1299; microtubule associated protein; microtubule associated serine threonine 1; unclassified drug; catenin; delta catenin; microRNA; MIRN1299 microRNA, human; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bioinformatics; cell migration; cell proliferation; colony formation; flow cytometry; fluorescence in situ hybridization; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; human; human cell; in vivo study; luciferase assay; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory mechanism; transwell assay; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell motion; cell proliferation; female; gene expression regulation; genetic database; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; metabolism; middle aged; nude mouse; pathology; signal transduction; tumor invasion; tumor volume","","Catenins, ; delta catenin, ; MicroRNAs, ; MIRN1299 microRNA, human, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","Harbin Medical University Daqing, (2015BAI13B00, DQWLD20, LBH-Q19140); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81800047); University Nursing Program for Young Scholar with Creative Talents in Heilongjiang Province, (UNPYSCT-2018067)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (contract grant numbers: 81800047 to X.Y.); University Nursing Program for Young Scholars with Creative Talents in Heilongjiang Province (contract grant numbers: UNPYSCT-2018067 to X.Y.); Wu Liande Young Scientific Research Foundation of Harbin Medical University Daqing (contract grant number: DQWLD20 to X.Y.).

In plants, an increasing number of studies have found that circRNAs can regulate plant metabolism and are involved in plant responses to biotic or abiotic stress. Acting as miRNA decoys is a critical way for circRNAs to perform their functions. Therefore, we developed GreenCircRNA - a database for plant circRNAs acting as miRNA decoys that is dedicated to providing a plant-based platform for detailed exploration of plant circRNAs and their potential decoy functions. This database includes over 210 000 circRNAs from 69 species of plants; the main data sources of circRNAs in this database are NCBI, EMBL-EBI and Phytozome. To investigate the function of circRNAs as competitive endogenous RNAs, the possibility of circRNAs from 38 plants to act as miRNA decoys was predicted. Moreover, we provide basic information for the circRNAs in the database, including their locations, host genes and relative expression levels, as well as full-length sequences, host gene GO (Gene Ontology) numbers and circRNA visualization. GreenCircRNA is the first database for the prediction of circRNAs that act as miRNA decoys and contains the largest number of plant species.

High-throughput sequencing provides a way to view circRNAs across different samples, especially in various diseases. However, there is still no comprehensive database for exploring the cancer-specific circRNAs. We collected 228 total RNA or polyA(-) RNA-seq samples from both cancer and normal cell lines, and identified 272 152 cancer-specific circRNAs. A total of 950 962 circRNAs were identified in normal samples only, and 170 909 circRNAs were identified in both tumor and normal samples, which could be further used as non-tumor background. We constructed a cancer-specific circRNA database (CSCD, http://gb.whu.edu.cn/CSCD). To understand the functional effects of circRNAs, we predicted the microRNA response element sites and RNA binding protein sites for each circRNA. We further predicted potential open reading frames to highlight translatable circRNAs. To understand the association between the linear splicing and the back-splicing, we also predicted the splicing events in linear transcripts of each circRNA. As the first comprehensive cancer-specific circRNA database, we believe CSCD could significantly contribute to the research for the function and regulation of cancer-associated circRNAs. © The Author(s) 2017.

One of the most important mechanisms involved is inflammation. Non-coding RNAs are proposed to play crucial roles in epigenetic modulation and post-transcriptional regulation. Identification of non-coding RNAs can show us the new insight into the molecular toxicity of PM2.5. Materials and methods: Intra-tracheal instillation of saline or PM2.5 was performed in BALB/c Mice once a week for consecutive eight weeks. Genomewide transcriptome profiling of coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in mice lung were done by ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA sequencing. Lung histological alternations were observed in haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining sections. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome were quantified by qRT-PCR、ELISA and Western blot. Results: 1873 coding genes, 885 lncRNAs and 142 circRNAs were differentially expressed in lung tissues of the saline and PM2.5 exposed mice. The upregulated expressions of lncRNA NONMMUT065867, lncRNA NONMMUT064312, lncRNA NONMMUT018123 and the downregulated expressions of circRNA CBT15_circR_1011, circRNA mm9_circ_005915 were identified by qRT-PCR in PM2.5 group. The pulmonary inflammation score was higher in PM2.5 group. What's more, the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NLRP3 inflammasome were upregulated in PM2.5 exposed mice. Conclusion: PM2.5 causes lung inflammation and increases the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome. The identified novel lncRNAs and circRNAs may paly important role in the development of lung inflammation caused by PM2.5. © 2019","Circular RNA; Inflammation; Long non-coding RNA; NLRP3 inflammasome; PM<sub>2.5</sub>","Air Pollutants; Animals; Cytokines; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Inflammasomes; Inflammation; Lung; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia; RNA; RNA, Long Noncoding; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Toxicity Tests; Transcriptional Activation; Mus; Biological organs; Codes (symbols); Genes; Mammals; Pathology; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; circular RNA; cryopyrin; cytokine; inflammasome; long untranslated RNA; ribosome RNA; RNA; transcriptome; unclassified drug; cytokine; inflammasome; long untranslated RNA; RNA; RNA, circular; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Inflammasome; Inflammation; Non-coding RNAs; PM2.5; Post-transcriptional regulations; Pro-inflammatory cytokines; Transcriptome profiling; gene expression; genome; identification method; particulate matter; protein; respiratory disease; RNA; rodent; toxicity; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genome analysis; histology; lung parenchyma; mouse; nonhuman; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; respiratory tract inflammation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; transcription regulation; upregulation; Western blotting; air pollutant; animal; Bagg albino mouse; genetics; inflammation; lung; male; metabolism; particulate matter; pneumonia; sequence analysis; toxicity; toxicity testing; transcription initiation; Particles (particulate matter)","","RNA, 63231-63-0; Air Pollutants, ; Cytokines, ; Inflammasomes, ; Particulate Matter, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ","","","National Key Research and Development Plan, (2017YFC1309500); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, (7161013, 7174357); Capital Foundation of Medical Development, (2016-1-4071)","The work is supported by the grants from Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (No. 7161013 and No. 7174357 ), Capital Foundation of Medical Development (No. 2016-1-4071 ) and National Key Research and Development Plan (No. 2017YFC1309500 ).

Numerous computational methods for detecting circRNAs from RNA-seq data have been developed in the past few years, but there are dramatic differences among the algorithms regarding the balancing of the sensitivity and precision of the detection and filtering strategies. To further improve the sensitivity, while maintaining an acceptable precision of circRNA detection, a novel and efficient de novo detection algorithm, CIRCPlus, is proposed in this paper. CIRCPlus accurately locates circRNA candidates by identifying a set of back-spliced junction reads by comparing the local similar sequence of each pair of spanning junction reads. This strategy, thus, utilizes the important information provided by unbalanced spanning reads, which facilitates the detection especially when the expression levels of circRNA are unapparent. The performance of CIRCPlus was tested and compared to the existing de novo methods on the real datasets as well as a series of simulation datasets with different configurations. The experiment results demonstrated that the sensitivities of CIRCPlus were able to reach 90% in common simulation settings, while CIRCPlus held balanced sensitivity and reliability on the real datasets according to an objective assessment criteria based on RNase R-treated samples. The software tool is available for academic uses only. © 2018 by the authors.

Some gene regions are fragmented in low quality and high-quality assemblies. Therefore, new approaches are needed to recover gene regions. Genomes are widely transcribed, generating messenger and non-coding RNAs. These widespread transcripts can be used to scaffold genomes and complete transcribed regions. Results: We present P_RNA_scaffolder, a fast and accurate tool using paired-end RNA-sequencing reads to scaffold genomes. This tool aims to improve the completeness of both protein-coding and non-coding genes. After this tool was applied to scaffolding human contigs, the structures of both protein-coding genes and circular RNAs were almost completely recovered and equivalent to those in a complete genome, especially for long proteins and long circular RNAs. Tested in various species, P_RNA_scaffolder exhibited higher speed and efficiency than the existing state-of-the-art scaffolders. This tool also improved the contiguity of genome assemblies generated by current mate-pair scaffolding and third-generation single-molecule sequencing assembly. Conclusions: The P_RNA_scaffolder can improve the contiguity of genome assembly and benefit gene prediction.

In recent years, many experimental studies have demonstrated that circRNAs are dysregulated in a number of diseases, and they can serve as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to identify circRNA-disease associations by biological experiments and few computational models have been proposed for novel circRNA-disease association prediction. In this study, we develop a computational model based on the random walk and the logistic regression (RWLR) to predict circRNA-disease associations. Firstly, a circRNA-circRNA similarity network is constructed by calculating their functional similarity of circRNA based on circRNA-related gene ontology. Then, a random walk with restart is implemented on the circRNA similarity network, and the features of each pair of circRNA-disease are extracted based on the results of the random walk and the circRNA-disease association matrix. Finally, a logistic regression model is used to predict novel circRNA-disease associations. Leave one out validation (LOOCV), five-fold cross validation (5CV) and ten-fold cross validation (10CV) are adopted to evaluate the prediction performance of RWLR, by comparing with the latest two methods PWCDA and DWNN-RLS. The experiment results show that our RWLR has higher AUC values of LOOCV, 5CV and 10CV than the other two latest methods, which demonstrates that RWLR has a better performance than other computational methods. What's more, case studies also illustrate the reliability and effectiveness of RWLR for circRNA-disease association prediction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CircRNA; CircRNA-disease association; Disease; Logistic regression; Random walk","Computation theory; Computational methods; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Genes; Random processes; RNA; Biological experiments; Computational model; Disease associations; Functional similarity; Logistic Regression modeling; Prediction performance; Protein-coding genes; Random walk with restart; Logistic regression","","","","","C hina Scholarship Council; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61602386, 61672334); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (3102019DX1003)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) ; C hina Scholarship Council (CSC) ; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant no. 61602386 ]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant no. 61672334 ]; and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under [Grant no. 3102019DX1003]. ; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); China Scholarship Council (CSC); the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant no. 61602386]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant no. 61672334]; and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under [Grant no. 3102019DX1003].","Ashwal-Fluss R., Meyer M., Pamudurti N.R., Ivanov A., Bartok O., Hanan M., Evantal N., Memczak S., Rajewsky N., Kadener S., circRNA biogenesis competes with pre-mRNA splicing, Mol.

Recently, the regulatory mechanisms of biogenesis and molecular functions, including miRNAs and RBPs sponge, translation as well as transcriptional and splicing regulation, have been gradually uncovered, although various aspects remained to be elucidated in combination with deep-sequence and bioinformatics. Accumulating studies have indicated that circRNAs are more enriched in neuronal tissues partly due to the abundance of specific genes promoting circularization, suggesting dysregulation of circRNAs is closely related to diseases of the nervous system, including glioma. In this review, we elaborate on the biogenesis, functions, databases as well as novel advances especially involved in the molecular pathways, highlight its great value as diagnostic or therapeutic targets in glioma. © 2020 The Author(s).","Biomarker;

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significance, biological function and molecular mechanism of circ-0067934 in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assayed expression level of circ-0067934 in NSCLC tissues and cell lines by Real-time PCR. The associations of circ-0067934 expression with clinicopathologic features and overall survival of patients with NSCLC were statistically analyzed. Biological functions of circ-0067934 were analyzed using MTT and transwell migration and invasion assays in vitro. The expression of EMT-related mRNAs and proteins was assayed using Real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: We found that circ-0067934 expression was significantly increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. High circ-0067934 expression was significantly associated with TNM stage (p=0.003), lymph node status (p=0.000), and distant metastasis (p=0.017). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that higher expression of circ-0067934 led to a significantly poorer survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis suggested that circ-0067934 was an independent poor prognostic factor for patients with NSCLC. In vitro assay indicated that down-regulation of circ-0067934 could suppress NSCLC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistic analysis showed that aberrant circ-0067934 expression could modulate the expression levels of markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that circ-0067934 functioned as an oncogenic circular RNA in NSCLC, which provided a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC. © 2018 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) where microRNAs (miRNAs) and lncRNAs regulate each other through their biding sites. Interactions of miRNAs and lncRNAs have been reported to trigger decay of the targeted lncRNAs and have important roles in target gene regulation. These interactions form complicated and intertwined networks. Certain lncRNAs encode miRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and may regulate expression of these small RNAs as precursors. SnoRNAs have also been reported to be precursors for PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and thus may regulate the piRNAs as a precursor. These miRNAs and piRNAs target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and regulate gene expression. In this review, we will present and discuss these interactions, cross-talk, and co-regulation of ncRNAs and gene regulation due to these interactions. © 2017, The Author(s).","Circular RNA; Competing endogenous RNA;

These transcripts have important roles in both physiological and pathological mechanisms due to their ability to directly influence cellular signaling pathways. Specifically, circRNAs are regulators of transcription, translation, protein interaction, and signal transduction. An increased knowledge within their area is observed over the last few years, concomitant with the development of next-generation sequencing techniques. circRNAs are mostly tissue and disease specific with the ability of specifically changing the biological behavior of cells. The altered expression profile is currently investigated as novel minimally invasive diagnosis/prognosis tool and also therapeutic target in human disease. The diagnosis approach is based on their level modification within pathological states, especially cancer, where circRNAs’ therapies are intensively explored in anti-aging strategies, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and malignant pathologies, and are relying on the restoration of homeostatic profiles. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biogenesis;

Therefore, deep understanding the pathogenesis for HCC is of great importance. The emergence of circular RNA (circRNA) provides a new way to study the pathogenesis of human disease. Here, we employed the prediction tool to identify circRNAs based on RNA-seq data. Then, to investigate the biological function of the circRNA, the candidate circRNAs were associated with the protein-coding genes (PCGs) by GREAT. We found significant candidate circRNAs expression alterations between normal and tumor samples. Additionally, the PCGs associated with these candidate circRNAs were also found have discriminative expression patterns between normal and tumor samples. The enrichment analysis illustrated that these PCGs were predominantly enriched for liver/cardiovascular- related diseases such as atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia and coronary heart disease, and participated in various metabolic processes. Together, a further network analysis indicated that these PCGs play important roles in the regulatory and the PPI network. Finally, we built a classification model to distinguish normal and tumor samples by using candidate circRNAs and their associated genes, respectively. Both of them obtained satisfactory results (∼ 0.99 of AUC for circRNA and PCG). Our findings suggested that the circRNA could be a critical factor in HCC, providing a useful resource to explore the pathogenesis of HCC. Copyright © 2017 Li et al.

One of the main pathological basis of this disease is the dysregulation of gene expression. Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a kind of functional RNA, which is transcript from DNA but not translated into proteins. More and more studies have established the important roles of ncRNAs, including transcription, RNA maturation, translation, protein degradation, and their involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This chapter will focus on the biological functions of ncRNAs and their advances in cardiovascular disease. With the development of sequencing and computer technology, more and more databases can be easily obtained on the internet. In another part of this chapter, we will summarize some commonly used non-coding RNA databases, which can be easily and quickly used for relevant research. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Cardiovascular disease;

The majority of circRNAs have a specific expression profile in cells or tissues, as well as during different stages of development. CircRNAs were originally thought to be the products of mis.splicing. However, with the assistance of bioinformatics tools and the rapid development of high.throughput sequencing, an increasing body of evidence has suggested that circRNAs bind micro(mi)RNAs, and have a role as miRNA sponges, thereby regulating target mRNA splicing and transcription. Human diseases are closely associated with circRNAs, especially in cancer as their expression is typically altered during the progression of cancer; this may provide a novel type of biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. CircRNAs are becoming a key area of interest within the field of cancer research. In the present review, we summarize the known molecular mechanisms and biological origin of circRNAs, as well as their functions, especially those related to human tumors. © Spandidos Publications 2018.

A role for circRNAs in sponging microRNAs (miRNAs) has been proposed, but the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction networks in human brain cells have not been defined. Therefore, we identified circRNAs in RNA sequencing data previously generated from astrocytes microdissected from the posterior cingulate (PC) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (N =10) and healthy elderly controls (N=10) using four circRNA prediction algorithms - CIRI, CIRCexplorer, find_circ and KNIFE. Results: Overall, utilizing these four tools, we identified a union of 4438 unique circRNAs across all samples, of which 70.3% were derived from exonic regions. Notably, the widely reported CDR1as circRNA was detected in all samples across both groups by find_circ. Given the putative miRNA regulatory function of circRNAs, we identified potential miRNA targets of circRNAs, and further, delineated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks using in silico methods. Pathway analysis of the genes regulated by these miRNAs identified significantly enriched immune response pathways, which is consistent with the known function of astrocytes as immune sensors in the brain. Conclusions: In this study, we performed circRNA detection on cell-specific transcriptomic data and identified potential circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks in PC astrocytes. Given the known function of astrocytes in cerebral innate immunity and our identification of significantly enriched immune response pathways, the circRNAs we identified may be associated with such key functions. While we did not detect recurrent differentially expressed circRNAs in the context of healthy controls or AD, we report for the first time circRNAs and their potential regulatory impact in a cell-specific and region-specific manner in aged subjects. These predicted regulatory network and pathway analyses may help provide new insights into transcriptional regulation in the brain. © 2018 The Author(s).","Aging; Astrocytes; Circular RNAs; Posterior cingulate; Regulatory network","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Astrocytes; Case-Control Studies; Cells, Cultured; Female; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Markers; Gyrus Cinguli; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; RNA; RNA, Messenger; circular RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 125a 3p; microRNA 125a 5p; microRNA 133b; microRNA 139 5p; microRNA 142 3p; microRNA 320a; microRNA 320b; microRNA 324 5p; microRNA 339 5p; microRNA 448; microRNA 449a; RNA; unclassified drug; messenger RNA; microRNA; RNA; RNA, circular; aged; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; Article; astrocyte; binding site; cell function; central nervous system; clinical article; computer model; controlled study; energy; energy metabolism; gene control; gene expression; gene function; gene regulatory network; gene targeting; glia cell; homeostasis; human; human cell; immune response; posterior cingulate; prediction; RNA binding; RNA sequence; senescence; astrocyte; case control study; cell culture; cingulate gyrus; cytology; female; genetic marker; genetics; high throughput sequencing; male; metabolism; pathology","","RNA, 63231-63-0; Genetic Markers, ; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Messenger, ","","","Arizona Alzheimer’s Research Center; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P30AG019610); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, (U24NS072026); Michael J.

Epigenetics has taken center stage in the study of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration; however, its integration into the field of environmental health sciences and toxicology (e.g. toxicoepigenetics) is in its infancy. This review highlights the need to evaluate surrogate and target tissues in the field of toxicoepigenetics as the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences multiphased Toxicant Exposure and Response by Genomic and Epigenomic Regulators of Transcription consortia make headway and the emergence of ncRNA biomarkers. The review also discusses lead (Pb) as a potential toxicoepigenetic exposure, where prenatal and postnatal Pb exposure is associated with reprogramming of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA expression, representing potential biomarkers or predictors for Pb-induced health outcomes. Finally, new advances in epigenome editing, highlighting the potential of small ncRNA, will be explored for environmental health sciences research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","circRNA; DNA methylation; Lead (Pb);

CircRNAs generally have low expression levels and relatively stable structures compared with messenger RNAs (mRNAs), most of which are located in the cytoplasm and often act in cell type and tissue-specific manners, indicating that they may serve as novel biomarkers. In recent years, circRNAs have gradually become a hotspot in the field of RNA and cancer research, but the functions of most circRNAs have not yet been discovered. Known circRNAs can affect the biogenesis of cancers in diverse ways, such as functioning as a microRNA (miRNA) sponges, combining with RNA binding proteins (RBPs), working as a transcription factor and translation of proteins. In this review, we summarize the characteristics and types of circRNAs, introduce the biogenesis of circRNAs, discuss the emerging functions and databases on circRNAs and present the current challenges of circRNAs studies. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cancer;

Recently, IRES elements have attracted much attention for their critical roles in various processes including translation initiation of a new type of RNA, circular RNA (circRNA), with no 5′ cap to support classical cap-dependent translation. Thus, an integrative data resource of IRES elements with experimental evidence will be useful for further studies. In this study, we present IRESbase, a comprehensive database of IRESs, by curating the experimentally validated functional minimal IRES elements from literature and annotating their host linear and circular RNAs. The current version of IRESbase contains 1328 IRESs, including 774 eukaryotic IRESs and 554 viral IRESs from 11 eukaryotic organisms and 198 viruses, respectively. As IRESbase collects only IRES of minimal length with functional evidence, the median length of IRESs in IRESbase is 174 nucleotides. By mapping IRESs to human circRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 2191 circRNAs and 168 lncRNAs were found to contain at least one entire or partial IRES sequence.

With improvements in next-generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics methods, some tools have been published for circRNA detection based on RNA-seq. Here, we developed the R package “Rcirc” for further analyses of circRNA after its detection. Rcirc identifies the coding ability of circRNA and visualizes various aspects of this feature. It also provides general visualization for both single circRNAs and meta-features of thousands of circRNAs.

According to the different sources of the sequences, circRNA can be divided into three types: exon circRNA (ecRNA), intron circRNA (ciRNA), and exon-intron circRNA. Accumulating studies have shown that circRNAs are abundant, diverse, stable, and cell or tissue specific expression, etc. CircRNA plays a regulating role in gene expression, and an essential role in the process of biological development, such as miRNA sponges, endogenous RNAs and biomarkers, as well as critical role in the diagnosis of diseases. Studies have verified the interplay between circRNAs and the development of embryos, sperms, ovarian epithelial tumors, endometrial cancer and preeclampsia, suggesting the potential of circRNAs to become biomarkers or therapeutical targets for human diseases. In this paper, we reviewed the researches on circRNAs’ characteristics, databases of circRNA, high-throughput sequencing of circRNA, and effect on reproductive and gynecological diseases. © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

The aim of this study was to identify key genes and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in GC diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy and to further explore the potential molecular mechanisms of GC. Material/Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and circRNAs (DE circRNAs) between GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues were identified from 3 mRNA and 3 circRNA expression profiles. Functional analyses were performed, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed. The signiﬁcant modules and key genes in the PPI networks were identified. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of these key genes. Potential miRNA-binding sites of the DE circRNAs and target genes of these miRNAs were predicted and used to construct DE circRNA–miRNA–mRNA networks. Results: A total of 196 upregulated and 311 downregulated genes were identified in GC. The results of functional analysis showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in a variety of functions and pathways, including extracellular matrix-related pathways. Ten hub genes (COL1A1, COL3A1, COL1A2, COL5A2, FN1, THBS1, COL5A1, SPARC, COL18A1, and COL11A1) were identified via PPI network analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 7 of these were associated with a poor overall survival in GC patients. Furthermore, we identified 2 DE circRNAs, hsa_circ_0000332 and hsa_circ_0021087. To reveal the potential molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in GC, DE circRNA–microRNA–mRNA networks were constructed. Conclusions: Key candidate genes and circRNAs were identified, and novel PPI and circRNA–microRNA–mRNA networks in GC were constructed.

Emerging evidence indicates that circRNA can influence cellular physiology through various molecular mechanisms. Thus, accurate circRNA identification and prediction of its regulatory information are critical for understanding its biogenesis. Although several computational tools based on machine learning have been proposed for circRNA identification, the prediction accuracy remains to be improved. Here, first we present circLGB, a machine learning-based framework to discriminate circRNA from other lncRNAs. circLGB integrates commonly used sequence-derived features and three new features containing adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) deamination, A-to-I density and the internal ribosome entry site. circLGB categorizes circRNAs by utilizing a LightGBM classifier with feature selection. Second, we introduce circMRT, an ensemble machine learning framework to systematically predict the regulatory information for circRNA, including their interactions with microRNA, the RNA binding protein, and transcriptional regulation. Feature sets including sequence-based features, graph features, genome context, and regulatory information features were modeled in circMRT. Experiments on public and our constructed datasets show that the proposed algorithms outperform the available state-of-the-art methods. circLGB is available at http://www.circlgb.com.

Specifically, circular RNAs (circRNAs) were only recently discovered as a new large group of non-coding RNAs that, due to their circular configuration, are metabolically more stable compared to their linear counterparts and therefore highly suitable for biomarker use. Based on high-throughput sequencing, the catalogs of endogenous circRNAs with disease relevance and correlation continue to grow steadily. As a consequence, circRNAs emerged as novel and attractive biomarkers, indicated by numerous recent publications. Here we would like to stress the need of essential quality criteria for validation and characterization of circular RNAs. In addition to high-throughput sequencing, classical biochemical methods are essential and should be applied for the characterization of this special class of RNAs, in particular to convincingly confirm their circularity. © 2019 The Authors","Biomarker; Circular RNA; Non-coding RNA","biological marker; circular RNA; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; algorithm; alternative RNA splicing; Article; biogenesis; bioinformatics; droplet digital polymerase chain reaction; exon; high throughput sequencing; human; in situ hybridization; liquid biopsy; next generation sequencing; Northern blotting; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reproducibility; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; RNA structure; validation study","","","","","","","Cech T.R., Steitz J.A., The noncoding RNA revolution-trashing old rules to forge new ones, Cell, 157, pp. 77-94, (2014); Sanger H.L., Klotz G., Riesner D., Gross H.J., Kleinschmidt A.K., Viroids are single-stranded covalently closed circular RNA molecules existing as highly base-paired rod-like structures, Proc.

Numerous tools have been developed for the detection of circRNAs, however computational tools to perform downstream functional analysis of circRNAs are scarce. Results: We present circRNAprofiler, an R-based computational framework that runs after circRNAs have been identified. It allows to combine circRNAs detected by multiple publicly available annotation-based circRNA detection tools and to analyze their expression, genomic context, evolutionary conservation, biogenesis and putative functions. Conclusions: Overall, the circRNA analysis workflow implemented by circRNAprofiler is highly automated and customizable, and the results of the analyses can be used as starting point for further investigation in the role of specific circRNAs in any physiological or pathological condition. © 2020 The Author(s).","Annotation;

Understanding the genomic dysregulations, in particularly non-coding RNA (ncRNA) dysregulations, in HCC may provide novel strategies to HCC treatment. In our previous study, we demonstrated the key role of miR-200a-mediated HMGB1/RAGE signaling in HCC carcinogenesis. In the present study, we identified circular RNA (circRNA)-miRNA pair that might modulate the migration of HCC cell lines based on previously reported GEO database (GSE78520 and GSE43445) and investigated the function and molecular mechanism. circRNA-101368 was predicted by lncTar to target miR-200a, and the expression of circRNA-101368 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissue samples; the overexpression of circRNA-101368 was correlated with poorer prognosis in patients with HCC. Moreover, circRNA-101368 knockdown suppressed the migration and the protein levels of HMGB1, RAGE and NF-κB, while increased the E-Cadherin expression in HCC cell lines. As confirmed by luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays, circRNA-101368 directly bound to miR-200a to negatively regulate each other. The effect of circRNA-101368 knockdown on cell migration and HMGB1/RAGE signaling could be partially attenuated by miR-200a inhibition. In tissue samples, miR-200a was negatively correlated with circRNA-101368 and HMGB1, respectively, whereas circRNA-101368 and HMGB1 was positively correlated. Taken together, we demonstrated a network of circRNAs-miRNA-mRNA in HCC and provided a novel mechanism of HCC cell migration regulation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","circRNA-101368;

To prove their circularity as well as biochemically enrich these transcripts, it has become standard in the field to use the 3'-5' exonuclease RNase R. Here, we demonstrate that standard protocols involving RNase R can fail to digest >20% of all highly expressed linear RNAs, but these shortcomings can largely be overcome. RNAs with highly structured 3' ends, including snRNAs and histone mRNAs, are naturally resistant to RNase R, but can be efficiently degraded once a poly(A) tail has been added to their ends. In addition, RNase R stalls in the body of many polyadenylated mRNAs, especially at G-rich sequences that have been previously annotated as G-quadruplex (G4) structures. Upon replacing K+ (which stabilizes G4s) with Li+ in the reaction buffer, we find that RNase R is now able to proceed through these sequences and fully degrade the mRNAs in their entirety. In total, our results provide important improvements to the current methods used to isolate circular RNAs as well as a way to reveal RNA structures that may naturally inhibit degradation by cellular exonucleases. © The Author(s) 2019.","","3' Flanking Region; Exoribonucleases; G-Quadruplexes; HeLa Cells; Humans; Lithium; Polyadenylation; Potassium; RNA; RNA Cleavage; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Small Nuclear; Sequence Analysis, RNA; buffer; circular ribonucleic acid; exonuclease; guanine quadruplex; histone; lithium ion; polyadenylic acid; potassium ion; ribonuclease; ribonuclease R; small nuclear RNA; unclassified drug; exoribonuclease; guanine quadruplex; lithium; messenger RNA; potassium; ribonuclease R; RNA; RNA, circular; small nuclear RNA; 3' untranslated region; Article; chemical reaction; controlled study; enzyme activity; gene expression; human; human cell; polyadenylation; protein RNA binding; RNA degradation; RNA purification; RNA sequence; RNA stability; RNA structure; 3' flanking region; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; HeLa cell line; isolation and purification; metabolism; RNA cleavage; sequence analysis","","exonuclease, 37228-74-3; histone, 9062-68-4; lithium ion, 17341-24-1; polyadenylic acid, 24937-83-5; potassium ion, 24203-36-9; ribonuclease, 59794-03-5, 9001-99-4; exoribonuclease, 37288-24-7; lithium, 7439-93-2; potassium, 7440-09-7; RNA, 63231-63-0; Exoribonucleases, ; Lithium, ; Potassium, ; ribonuclease R, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Messenger, ; RNA, Small Nuclear, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (R35GM119735); Rita Allen Foundation, RAF","National Institutes of Health [R35-GM119735]; J.E.W. is a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar.

However, there has been a lack of systematic and comprehensive analysis to further elucidate its underlying role in cancer. In the current study, we firstly performed a bioinformatics analysis of CDR1as among 868 cancer samples by using RNA-seq datasets of the MiOncoCirc database. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), CIBERSORT, Estimating the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), and the MAlignant Tumors using Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm were applied to investigate the underlying functions and pathways. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that CDR1as has roles associated with angiogenesis, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, integrin binding, and collagen binding. Moreover, pathway analysis indicated that it may regulate the TGF-β signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction. Therefore, we used CIBERSORT, EPIC, and the ESTIMATE algorithm to investigate the association between CDR1as expression and the tumor microenvironment. Our data strongly suggest that CDR1as may play a specific role in immune and stromal cell infiltration in tumor tissue, especially those of CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells, M2 macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and endothelial cells. Generally, systematic and comprehensive analyses of CDR1as were conducted to shed light on its underlying pro-cancerous mechanism. CDR1as regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction to serve as a mediator in alteration of the tumor microenvironment. © 2019 by the authors.

Now, circRNAs are considered functional molecules, although to date, only few functions have been experimentally validated. Here, based on RNA sequencing from the ENCODE consortium, we identify and characterize a subset of circRNAs, coined AUG circRNAs, encompassing the annotated translational start codon from the protein-coding host genes. AUG circRNAs are more abundantly expressed and conserved than other groups of circRNAs, and they display flanking sequences that suggest an Alu-independent mechanism of biogenesis. The AUG circRNAs contain part of bona fide open reading frame, and in the recent years, several studies have reported cases of circRNA translation. However, using thorough cross-species analysis, extensive ribosome profiling, proteomics analyses, and experimental data on a selected panel of AUG circRNAs, we observe no indications of translation of AUG circRNAs or any other circRNAs. Our data provide a comprehensive classification of circRNAs and, collectively, the data suggest that the AUG circRNAs constitute an abundant subclass of circRNAs produced independently of primate-specific Alu elements. © 2019 Stagsted et al.","","Animals; Cell Line; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Evolution, Molecular; Exons; Gene Expression Profiling; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mice; MicroRNAs; Open Reading Frames; Protein Biosynthesis; Proteomics; RNA, Circular; RNA, Untranslated; Transcriptome; microRNA; transcriptome; untranslated RNA; animal; cell line; exon; gene expression profiling; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human; molecular evolution; mouse; nucleic acid database; open reading frame; procedures; protein synthesis; proteomics","","MicroRNAs, ; RNA, Circular, ; RNA, Untranslated, ","","","Novo Nordisk Fonden, NNF, (NNF16OC0019874)","We would like to thank Karoline Krogh Ebbesen for the insightful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript.

CirRNA regulates gene expression by modulating microRNAs and functions as potential biomarker. CirRNAs can translate in vivo to link between their expression and disease. They are resistant to RNA exonuclease and can convert to the linear RNA by microRNA which can then act as competitor to endogenous RNA. This chapter summarizes the evolutionary conservation and expression of cirRNAs, their identification, highlighting various computational approaches on cirRNA, and translation with a focus on the breakthroughs and the challenges in this new field. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Circular RNAs; cirRNA; Gene expression; Translation","Blotting, Northern; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Regulation; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; MicroRNAs; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA, Long Noncoding; circ ZNF609; circular RNA; cirMbl; microRNA; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; RNA; RNA, circular; algorithm; alternative RNA splicing; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression; genome; high throughput sequencing; human; immunoprecipitation; internal ribosome entry site; nonhuman; Northern blotting; open reading frame; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; ribosome; RNA sequence; RNA structure; RNA translation; biology; chemistry; gene expression regulation; genetics; procedures; protein synthesis; RNA processing","","RNA, 63231-63-0; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ","","","","","Liu L., Wang J., Khanabdali R., Et al., Circular RNAs: Isolation, characterization and their potential role in diseases, RNA Biol, 14, 12, pp. 1715-1721, (2017); Li J., Yang J., Zhou P., Et al., Circular RNAs in cancer: Novel insights into origins, properties, functions and implications, Am J Cancer Res, 5, 2, (2015); Li P., Chen S., Chen H., Et al., Using circular RNA as a novel type of biomarker in the screening of gastric cancer, Clin Chim Acta, 444, pp. 132-136, (2015); Greene J., Baird A.M., Brady L., Et al., Circular RNAs: Biogenesis, function and role in human diseases, Front Mol Biosci, 4, (2017); Hansen T.B., Kjems J., Damgaard C.K., Circular RNA and miR-7 in cancer, Cancer Res, 73, 18, pp. 5609-5612, (2013); Bachmayr-Heyda A., Reiner A.T., Auer K., Et al., Correlation of circular RNA abundance with proliferation–exemplified with colorectal and ovarian cancer, idiopathic lung fibrosis, and normal human tissues, Sci Rep, 5, (2015); Barrett S.P., Salzman J., Circular RNAs: Analysis, expression and potential functions, Development, 143, 11, pp. 1838-1847, (2016); Lasda E., Parker R., Circular RNAs: Diversity of form and function, RNA, 20, 12, pp. 1829-1842, (2014); Chen I., Chen C.Y., Chuang T.J., Biogenesis, identification, and function of exonic circular RNAs, Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA, 6, 5, pp. 563-579, (2015); Bahn J.H., Zhang Q., Li F., Et al., The landscape of microRNA, Piwi-interacting RNA, and circular RNA in human saliva, Clin Chem, 61, 1, pp. 221-230, (2015); Gao Y., Wang J., Zhao F., CIRI: An efficient and unbiased algorithm for de novo circular RNA identification, Genome Biol, 16, 1, (2015); Jeck W.R., Sharpless N.E., Detecting and characterizing circular RNAs, Nat Biotechnol, 32, 5, (2014); Jeck W.R., Sorrentino J.A., Wang K., Et al., Circular RNAs are abundant, conserved, and associated with ALU repeats, RNA, 19, 2, pp. 141-157, (2013); Xiong H.Y., Alipanahi B., Lee L.J., Et al., The human splicing code reveals new insights into the genetic determinants of disease, Science, 347, 6218, (2015); Hansen T.B., Characterization of circular RNA concatemers, Circular Rnas, pp. 143-157, (2018); Hansen T.B., Wiklund E.D., Bramsen J.B., MiRNA-dependent gene silencing involving Ago2-mediated cleavage of a circular antisense RNA, EMBO J, 30, 21, pp. 4414-4422, (2011); Gingeras T.R., Implications of chimaeric non-co-linear transcripts, Nature, 461, 7261, (2009); Itzkovitz S., van Oudenaarden A., Validating transcripts with probes and imaging technology, Nature Methods, 8, 4s, (2011); Gunzl A., Palfi Z., Bindereif A., Analysis of RNA–protein complexes by oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H digestion, Methods, 26, 2, pp. 162-169, (2002); Tabak H.F., van der Horst G., Smit J., Discrimination between RNA circles, interlocked RNA circles and lariats using two-dimensional poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, Nucleic Acids Res, 16, 14, pp. 6597-6605, (1988); Wang P.L., Bao Y., Yee M.C., Et al., Circular RNA is expressed across the eukaryotic tree of life, Plos One, 9, 3, (2014); You X., Vlatkovic I., Babic A., Neural circular RNAs are derived from synaptic genes and regulated by development and plasticity, Nat Neurosci, 18, 4, (2015); Barrett S.P., Wang P.L., Salzman J., Circular RNA Biogenesis Can Proceed through an Exon-Containing Lariat Precursor, (2015); Jakobi T., Dieterich C., Deep computational circular RNA analytics from RNA-seq data, Methods Mol Biol, 1724, pp. 9-25, (2018); Reznichenko A., Translational Renal Genetics.

However, the function of circRNAs in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is largely unknown. Methods: We performed circRNA microarrays to identify circRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in TNBC cell lines. Expression levels of a significantly upregulated circRNA, circGFRA1, was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in TNBC cell lines and tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to explore the significance of circGFRA1 in clinical prognosis. Then, we examined the functions of circGFRA1 in TNBC by cell proliferation, apoptosis and mouse xenograft assay. In addition, luciferase assay was used to explore the miRNA sponge function of circGFRA1 in TNBC. Results: Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR verified a circRNA termed circGFRA1 that was upregulated in TNBC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that upregulated circGFRA1 was correlated with poorer survival. Knockdown of circGFRA1 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in TNBC. Via luciferase reporter assays, circGFRA1 and GFRA1 was observed to directly bind to miR-34a. Subsequent experiments showed that circGFRA1 and GFRA1 regulated the expression of each other by sponging miR-34a. Conclusions: Taken together, we conclude that circGFRA1 may function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate GFRA1 expression through sponging miR-34a to exert regulatory functions in TNBC. circGFRA1 may be a diagnostic biomarker and potential target for TNBC therapy. © 2017 The Author(s).","Circular RNAs;

With the development of high-throughput sequencing, massive circRNAs have been discovered in tumorous tissues. Emerging evidence suggests that the biological functions of circRNAs including serving as ceRNAs or miRNA sponges, interacting with proteins, regulating gene transcription and translation, suggesting that circRNAs will be novel biomarkers and targets for the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. It is vital to understand the molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of proliferation and progression. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on human circRNAs and their potential clinical implications on breast cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).","Biomarker; Breast cancer; Circular RNA; miRNA;

Despite advances in therapeutic approaches, the 5-year survival rate of patients with GC remains poor. A type of non-coding RNA, circular RNA (circRNA), has been discovered. Some circRNAs are dysregulated in cancer and may have important functions. Thus, circRNAs could be candidate biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Our study used a reannotation framework to derive expression values of circRNAs from microarray data sets. We used an integrated pipeline including differential expression analysis and Cox regression analyses to detect GC-associated circRNA signatures. We validated results with 54 paired gastric tumor and adjacent normal tissues. Five circRNA signatures were highly associated with patient overall survival and disease-free survival. Real-time PCR experiments on hsa-circ-0103398 and hsa-circ-0127859 in tumors and normal tissues showed that these circRNAs were significantly upregulated in GC. High expression of hsa-circ-0103398 and hsa-circ-0127859 was closely associated with unfavorable survival time. Our findings indicated that a 5-circRNA signature might serve as a candidate prognostic biomarker of GC. © American Federation for Medical Research 2020. No commercial re-use.

Recent studies have reported cognitive dysfunction in obese patients is caused by a high fat diet. Accordingly, such dysfunction is called ""type 3 diabetes"" or ""diabetic dementia."" Although dysregulation of protein-coding genes has been extensively studied, profiling of non-coding RNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) has not been reported yet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to obtain profiles of diverse RNAs and determine their patterns of alteration in high fat fed brain cortex compared to normal brain cortex. To investigate regulatory roles of both coding and non-coding RNAs in high fat diet brain, we performed RNA sequencing of ribosomal RNA-depleted RNAs and identified genome-wide lncRNAs and circRNAs expression and co-expression patterns of mRNAs in high fat diet mouse brain cortex. Our results showed expression levels of mRNAs related to neurogenesis, synapse, and calcium signaling were highly changed in high fat diet fed cortex. In addition, numerous differentially expressed lncRNAs and circRNAs were identified.

Sci., KBRIN Bioinformatics Core, Louisville, 40292, KY, United States","Alternative splicing refers to the production of multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene due to alternative selection of exons or splice sites during pre-mRNA splicing. While canonical alternative splicing produces a linear form of RNA by joining an upstream donor site (5' splice site) with a downstream acceptor site (3' splice site), a special form of alternative splicing produces a non-coding circular form of RNA (circular RNA) by ligating a downstream donor site (5' splice site) with an upstream acceptor site (3' splice site); i.e., back-splicing. Over the past two decades, many studies have discovered this special form of alternative splicing that produces a circular form of RNA. Although these circular RNAs have garnered considerable attention in the scientific community for their biogenesis and functions, the focus of these studies has been on exonic circular RNAs (circRNAs: donor site and acceptor site are from exon boundaries) and circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs: donor and acceptor are from a single intron). This type of approach was conducted in the relative absence of methods for searching another group of circular RNAs, or circular complex RNAs (ccRNAs: either the donor site or acceptor site is not from exon boundaries), that contains at least one exon and one or more flanking introns. Studies of ccRNAs would serve as a significant first step in filling this void. In this paper, we developed a new computational algorithm that can detect all three types of circular RNAs. We applied our algorithm on a set of RNA-seq data to examine the composition of circular RNAs in the given dataset. Surprisingly, our results showed that the new type of circular RNA (ccRNA) was the second most common type of circular RNA while circRNA was the most common type as expected. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Alternative Splicing; Circular RNA; High-throughput sequencing; RNA-seq","Bioinformatics; RNA; Throughput; Alternative selections; Alternative splicing; Computational algorithm; Donor and acceptor; Exon boundaries; High-throughput sequencing; pre-mRNA splicing; Scientific community; Nucleic acids","","","","","National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (8P20GM103436-14)","We would like to thank Julia Chariker for insightful discussions and comments.

Recently, many studies have shown that circRNAs can be regarded as micro RNA (miRNA) sponges, which are known to be associated with certain diseases. Therefore efficient computation methods are needed to explore miRNAcircRNA interactions, but only very few computational methods for predicting the associations between miRNAs and circRNAs exist. In this study, we adopt an improved random walk computational method, named KRWRMC, to express complicated associations between miRNAs and circRNAs. Our major contributions can be summed up in two points. First, in the conventional Random Walk Restart Heterogeneous (RWRH) algorithm, the computational method simply converts the circRNA/miRNA similarity network into the transition probability matrix; in contrast, we take the influence of the neighbor of the node in the network into account, which can suggest or stress some potential associations. Second, our proposed KRWRMC is the first computational model to calculate large numbers of miRNA-circRNA associations, which can be regarded as biomarkers to diagnose certain diseases and can thus help us to better understand complicated diseases. The reliability of KRWRMC has been verified by Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) and 10-fold cross validation, the results of which indicate that this method achieves excellent performance in predicting potential miRNA-circRNA associations.  © 2020 The author(s).","Heterogeneous network; MiRNA-circRNA associations; Multi-label; Random walk restart","Association reactions; Computational methods; Forecasting; Gene expression; Gene expression regulation; Heterogeneous networks; Nearest neighbor search; Random processes; Statistical methods; 10-fold cross-validation; Biological process; Computational model; Efficient computation; Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV); Post-transcriptional; Similarity network; Transition probability matrix; RNA","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61672334); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (GK201901010)","Science Foundation of China (No. 61672334) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. GK201901010).","Andreeva K., Cooper N.G.F., Circular RNAs: New players in gene regulation, Adv.

These motifs are embedded in a compact secondary structure whose elucidation is crucial to understand how they function. Viroid RNA structure has been tackled in silico with algorithms searching for the conformation of minimal free energy, and in vitro by probing in solution with RNases, dimethyl sulphate and bisulphite, and with selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE), which interrogates the RNA backbone at single-nucleotide resolution. However, in vivo approaches at that resolution have not been assayed. Here, after confirming by 3 termodynamics-based predictions and by in vitro SHAPE that the secondary structure adopted by the infectious monomeric circular (+) RNA of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) is a rod-like conformation with double-stranded segments flanked by loops, we have probed it in vivo with a SHAPE modification. We provide direct evidence that a similar, but not identical, rod-like conformation exists in PSTVd-infected leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana, verifying the long-standing view that this RNA accumulates in planta as a “naked” form rather than tightly associated with protecting host proteins. However, certain nucleotides of the central conserved region, including some of the loop E involved in key functions such as replication, are more SHAPE-reactive in vitro than in vivo. This difference is most likely due to interactions with proteins mediating some of these functions, or to structural changes promoted by other factors of the in vivo habitat. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Circular RNAs; non-coding RNAs; RNA secondary structure; SHAPE in vivo; viroids","Acylation; Algorithms; Base Pairing; Base Sequence; Cell Nucleus; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Plant Cells; Plant Leaves; Potyvirus; Ribonucleases; RNA; RNA, Viral; Software; Sulfites; Sulfuric Acid Esters; Thermodynamics; Tobacco; Viroids; Virus Replication; acid anhydride; circular RNA; nucleotide; RNA; unclassified drug; dimethyl sulfate; hydrogen sulfite; ribonuclease; RNA; RNA, circular; sulfate; sulfite; virus RNA; Article; computer model; computer prediction; in vitro study; male; Nicotiana benthamiana; nonhuman; plant leaf; Potato spindle tuber viroid; RNA conformation; RNA secondary structure; RNA structure; viral plant disease; viroid; acylation; algorithm; base pairing; cell nucleus; chemistry; conformation; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; plant cell; Potyvirus; software; thermodynamics; tobacco; viroid; virology; virus replication","","RNA, 63231-63-0; dimethyl sulfate, 77-78-1; ribonuclease, 59794-03-5, 9001-99-4; sulfate, 14808-79-8; sulfite, 14265-45-3; dimethyl sulfate, ; hydrogen sulfite, ; Ribonucleases, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Viral, ; Sulfites, ; Sulfuric Acid Esters, ","","","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO","This work was supported by grant BFU2014-56812-P (to R.F.) from the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad of Spain.

They have been confirmed to participate in many biological processes, including playing roles in transcriptional regulation, regulating protein-coding genes, and binding to RNA-associated proteins. Until now, the differences between these two types of non-coding RNAs have not been fully uncovered. It is still quite difficult to detect cirRNAs from other lncRNAs using simple techniques. In this study, we investigated these two types of non-coding RNAs using several computational methods. The purpose was to extract important factors that could distinguish cirRNAs from other lncRNAs and build an effective classification model to distinguish them. First, we collected cirRNAs, lncRNAs and their representations from a previous study, in which each cirRNA or lncRNA was represented by 188 features derived from its graph representation, sequence and conservation properties. Second, these features were analyzed by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method. The obtained mRMR feature list, incremental feature selection method and hierarchical extreme learning machine algorithm were employed to build an optimal classification model with sensitivity of 0.703, specificity of 0.850, accuracy of 0.789 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.561. Finally, we analyzed the 16 most important features. Of them, the sequences and structures of the RNA molecule were top ranking, implying they can be potential indicators of differences between cirRNAs and other lncRNAs. Meanwhile, other features of evolutionary conversation, sequence consecution were also important. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","cirRNAs; Hierarchical extreme learning machine algorithm; lncRNAs;

Unlike other cellular RNAs, circular (circ)RNAs include a large family of noncoding (nc)RNAs that lack the 5′ or 3′ ends. The improvements in high-throughput RNA sequencing and novel bioinformatics tools have led to the identification of thousands of circRNAs in various organisms. CircRNAs can regulate gene expression by influencing the transcription, the mRNA turnover, and translation by sponging RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs. Given the broad impact of circRNA on miRNA activity, there is huge interest in understanding the impact of miRNA sponging by circRNA on gene regulation. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the miRNA-circRNA interaction and mechanisms that influence gene expression. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","circRNA; Competing endogenous RNA;

Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs exert a new layer of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. However, there is no standard nomenclature of circRNA, although the study of circRNAs has exploded in the past few years. Here we present circbank (www.circbank.cn), a comprehensive database for human circRNAs, where a novel naming system of circRNAs based on the host genes of circRNAs was implemented. In addition to the new naming system, circbank collected other five features of circRNAs including the miRNA binding site, conservation of circRNAs, m6A modification of circRNAs, mutation of circRNAs and protein-coding potential of circRNAs. Circbank is publicly available and allows users to query, browse and download circRNAs with all six features we provided, based on different search criteria. The database may serve as a resource to facilitate the research of function and regulation of circRNAs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","circbank; CircRNAs; database;

These have been identified in a wide variety of tissues and cell types from many eukaryotes, and are now known to be mostly circular, cytoplasmic, and non-coding. Although there is no uniformly ascribed function, several have been shown to be involved in gene regulation. Accurate identification of these transcripts can, however, be difficult due to artefacts from a wide variety of sources. Results: Here, we present a computational method, PTESFinder, to identify these transcripts from high throughput RNAseq data. Uniquely, it systematically excludes potential artefacts emanating from pseudogenes, segmental duplications, and template switching, and outputs both PTES and canonical exon junction counts to facilitate comparative analyses. In comparison with four existing methods, PTESFinder achieves highest specificity and comparable sensitivity at a variety of read depths. PTESFinder also identifies between 13 % and 41.6 % more structures, compared to publicly available methods recently used to identify human circular RNAs. Conclusions: With high sensitivity and specificity, user-adjustable filters that target known sources of false positives, and tailored output to facilitate comparison of transcript levels, PTESFinder will facilitate the discovery and analysis of these poorly understood transcripts. © 2016 Izuogu et al.","CircRNA;

However, the limited availability of genomic and molecular information limits our understanding of this complex physiological process. In this study, we characterized the transcriptome between immature (30-day-old) and mature (180-day-old) pig testes using RNA-seq technology. 24,469 known coding gene transcripts corresponding to 20,566 genes were mapped in these two developmental stages, 3,328 genes were differentially expressed, and numerous novel transcripts and alternative splicing events were also identified. Ten differentially expressed genes were validated by measuring the relative expression using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 125 Gene Ontology (GO) terms were significantly enriched, and most of them involved in GO terms related to male reproduction, testicular development, and spermatogenesis. In addition, this study also represented the prediction of 10,000 circRNAs, as well as the validation of six pig circRNAs using Find_cric algorithm. Our study substantially expanded our knowledge about the transcriptomic profile of immature and mature pig testes, and provided a useful resource to study the mechanisms of pig testis development and spermatogenesis at the molecular level. © 2017, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","CircRNAs;

Despite encouraging results achieved with targeted therapy in recent years, the early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer remains a major problem. Circular RNA (circRNA), a type of RNA with covalently closed continuous loop structures, has structural stability and certain tissue specificity. Recent studies have found that circRNAs have an important role in tumor development and are expected to be revealed as new targets for tumor prediction and treatment. Research on the biological functions and regulation mechanisms of circRNAs in lung cancer is in its infancy but is gathering momentum. In this review, we discuss the properties, biogenesis, biological function, and research progress of circRNAs in lung cancer to provide a theoretical foundation and new directions for studies on circRNAs in lung cancer. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","back-splicing; biogenesis; biomarkers; circular RNA; Lung cancer; microRNA sponge; therapeutic target","Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Research Design; RNA, Circular; circular RNA; microRNA; RNA; RNA binding protein; tumor marker; unclassified drug; biogenesis; cancer research; data base; gene expression regulation; human; lung cancer; Review; RNA translation; theoretical study; genetics; lung tumor; methodology; pathology","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, Circular, ","","","","","Jemal A., Bray F., Center M.M., Ferlay J., Ward E., Forman D., Global cancer statistics.

Recently, it was demonstrated that they could encode proteins or peptides. However, relevant information is scattered across numerous published articles, which is inconvenient for the exploration of ncRNA translation by researchers. In this study, we presented an ncEP database, which records the low-throughput experimentally validated (LTEV) proteins or peptides encoded by ncRNAs, from published articles. Collectively, ncEP contains 80 entries including 74 proteins or peptides, 22 lncRNAs, 11 circRNAs, 9 pri-miRNAs and 37 other ncRNAs across 18 species from more than 50 articles of over 2000 candidate articles. We have provided a user-friendly interface for users to search, browse, visualize, download and submit data. In summary, ncEP provides a relatively comprehensive repository of the LTEV proteins or peptides encoded by ncRNAs and will enrich the knowledge for translation process. ncEP is freely available at http://www.jianglab.cn/ncEP/. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","circRNA; lncRNA; ncRNA; peptide; translation","Databases, Nucleic Acid; Humans; Internet; MicroRNAs; Peptides; Proteins; RNA, Circular; RNA, Untranslated; circular ribonucleic acid; long untranslated RNA; peptide; primary microRNA; protein; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; microRNA; peptide; protein; untranslated RNA; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; controlled study; data base; Drosophila melanogaster; genome; human; information processing; ncEP database; nonhuman; online genome browser; priority journal; genetics; Internet; nucleic acid database","","protein, 67254-75-5; MicroRNAs, ; Peptides, ; Proteins, ; RNA, Circular, ; RNA, Untranslated, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61571169, 61872183); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (NE2018101)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61872183 and 61571169 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( NE2018101 ).

However, the mechanism of hsa_circ_0052112 in breast cancer cells is not entirely clear. Hsa_circ_0052112, generated from the ZNF83 gene, is selected by analyzing circRNA expression profiles of breast cancer cell by using microarray assay. In this study, we will show the role of hsa_circ_0052112 in regulating cell invasion and migration in breast cancer. Methods: The expression level of hsa_circ_0052112 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was detected by RT-qPCR; we performed transwell assay to evaluate breast cancer cells’ migration and invasion; predicated circRNA/miRNAs interaction using the miRanda and RNAhybrid software; identified the relationship between hsa_circ_0052112 and miR-125a-5p by luciferase activity assay and show the localization of hsa_circ_0052112 by FISH assay and show the significance of ZNF83 in clinical prognosis by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: Hsa_circ_0052112 expression was significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 cells than that in MCF-7 cells. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0052112 promoted cell migration and invasion in breast cancer. Inversely, down-regulation of hsa_circ_0052112 suppressed breast cancer cells migration and invasion. Hsa_circ_0052112 was mostly located in cytoplasm. Hsa_circ_0052112 could directly sponge to miR-125a-5p; overexpression of miR-125a-5p significantly inhibited breast cancer cells migration and invasion. However, high or low expression of miR-125a-5p was not correlated with relapse free survival (RFS) by TCGA database validation, but high expression of ZNF83 was closely correlated with poor RFS by Kaplan–Meier plotter. Conclusions: These data suggest that hsa_circ_0052112 may be a potent biomarker for breast cancer, and may provide a new perspective on treatment of breast cancer. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Breast cancer; circRNAs; hsa_circ_0052112; miRNA-125a-5p","Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; MCF-7 Cells; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Invasiveness; RNA; Up-Regulation; beta actin; circular RNA 0052112; luciferase; microRNA; microRNA 125a 5p; tumor marker; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN125 microRNA, human; RNA; RNA, circular; Article; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell invasion assay; cell migration; cell migration assay; cellular distribution; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cytoplasm; down regulation; enzyme activity; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression; gene expression level; gene overexpression; human; human cell; interactions with RNA; luciferase assay; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; priority journal; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; recurrence free survival; survival analysis; tumor invasion; validation process; breast tumor; cell motion; cell proliferation; female; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; mortality; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; upregulation","","RNA, 63231-63-0; MicroRNAs, ; MIRN125 microRNA, human, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ","","","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20151579); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFC0905900)","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0905900 ); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20151579 ).","Siegel R.L., Miller K.D., Jemal A., Cancer statistics, 2016, CA Cancer J.

Although the exact function of many circRNAs is largely unknown, the cell type-and tissue-specific circRNA expression has implicated their crucial functions in many biological processes. Hence, the quantification of circRNA expression from high-throughput RNA-seq data is becoming important to ascertain. Although many model-based methods have been developed to quantify linear RNA expression from RNA-seq data, these methods are not applicable to circRNA quantification. Results: Here, we proposed a novel strategy that transforms circular transcripts to pseudo-linear transcripts and estimates the expression values of both circular and linear transcripts using an existing model-based algorithm, Sailfish. The new strategy can accurately estimate transcript expression of both linear and circular transcripts from RNA-seq data. Several factors, such as gene length, amount of expression and the ratio of circular to linear transcripts, had impacts on quantification performance of circular transcripts. In comparison to count-based tools, the new computational framework had superior performance in estimating the amount of circRNA expression from both simulated and real ribosomal RNA-depleted (rRNA-depleted) RNA-seq datasets. On the other hand, the consideration of circular transcripts in expression quantification from rRNA-depleted RNA-seq data showed substantial increased accuracy of linear transcript expression. Our proposed strategy was implemented in a program named Sailfish-cir. © 2017 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press.

While initially considered as product of aberrant splicing, recent evidence suggests unique functions and conservation across evolution. While circular RNAs could be largely attributed to have little or no potential to encode for proteins, recent evidence points to at least a small subset of circular RNAs which encode for peptides. Circular RNAs are also increasingly shown to be biomarkers for a number of diseases including neurological disorders and cancer. The advent of deep sequencing has enabled large-scale identification of circular RNAs in human and other genomes. A number of computational approaches have come up in recent years to query circular RNAs on a genome-wide scale from RNA-seq data. In this chapter, we describe the application and methodology of identifying circular RNAs using three popular computational tools: FindCirc, Segemehl, and CIRI along with approaches for experimental validation of the unique splice junctions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019.","circRNAs; Circular RNA; CIRI; FindCirc; Segemehl","Biomarkers; Computational Biology; Datasets as Topic; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Neoplasms; Nervous System Diseases; RNA; RNA Splicing; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Software; biological marker; RNA; biological marker; RNA; RNA, circular; analytic method; exon; genome; human; malignant neoplasm; neurologic disease; RNA sequence; RNA splicing; validation study; biology; devices; genetics; high throughput sequencing; information processing; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular genetics; neoplasm; neurologic disease; procedures; sequence analysis; software","","RNA, 63231-63-0; Biomarkers, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ","","","","","Lasda E., Parker R., Circular RNAs: Diversity of form and function, RNA, 20, pp. 1829-1842, (2014); Cocquerelle C., Mascrez B., Hetuin D., Bailleul B., Mis-splicing yields circular RNA molecules, FASEB J, 7, pp. 155-160, (1993); Kulcheski F.R., Christoff A.P., Margis R., Circular RNAs are miRNA sponges and can be used as a new class of biomarker, J Biotechnol, 238, pp. 42-51, (2016); Qu S., Yang X., Li X., Et al., Circular RNA: A new star of noncoding RNAs, Cancer Lett, 365, pp. 141-148, (2015); Vidal A.F., Sandoval G.T.V., Magalhaes L., Et al., Circular RNAs as a new field in gene regulation and their implications in translational research, Epigenomics, 8, pp. 551-562, (2016); Kos A., Dijkema R., Arnberg A.C., Et al., The hepatitis delta (Delta) virus possesses a circular RNA, Nature, 323, pp. 558-560, (1986); Maoz R., Garfinkel B.P., Soreq H., Alzheimer’s disease and ncRNAs, Adv Exp Med Biol, 978, pp. 337-361, (2017); Kumar L., Shamsuzzama J.P., Et al., Functional characterization of novel circular RNA molecule, circzip-2 and its synthesizing gene zip-2 in C.

Circular RNA is a novel endogenous noncoding RNA that plays significant roles in regulating gene expression, moderating the microRNAs transcription as sponges, diagnosing diseases, and so on. Based on the circRNA particular molecular structures that are closed-loop structures with neither 5′-3′ polarities nor polyadenylated tails, circRNAs are more stable and conservative than the normal linear coding or noncoding RNAs, which makes circRNAs a biomarker of various diseases. Although some conventional experiments are used to identify the associations between circRNAs and diseases, almost the techniques and experiments are time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we propose a collaboration filtering recommendation system–based computational method, which handles the “cold start” problem to predict the potential circRNA–disease associations, which is named ICFCDA. All the known circRNA–disease associations data are downloaded from circR2Disease database (http://bioinfo.snnu.edu.cn/CircR2Disease/). Based on these data, multiple data are extracted from different databases to calculate the circRNA similarity networks and the disease similarity networks. The collaboration filtering recommendation system algorithm is first employed to predict circRNA–disease associations. Then, the leave-one-out cross validation mechanism is adopted to measure the performance of our proposed computational method. ICFCDA achieves the areas under the curve of 0.946, which is better than other existing methods. In order to further illustrate the performance of ICFCDA, case studies of some common diseases are made, and the results are confirmed by other databases. The experimental results show that ICFCDA is competent in predicting the circRNA–disease associations. © 2019 Lei, Fang and Guo.","circRNA-disease association; Collaboration filtering; Multiple biological data; Neighbor information; Recommendation system","circular RNA; long untranslated RNA; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; algorithm; area under the curve; Article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; computer model; digital filtering; disease association; disease similarity; gene expression; gene regulatory network; genetic similarity; human; information processing; kernel method; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; metric system; molecular genetics; mortality rate; pattern recognition; performance; receiver operating characteristic; RNA sequence; semantics; system analysis; validation study","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61672334, 61902230, 61972451); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (GK201901010)","This work was supported by the funding from National Natural Science Foundation of China (61972451, 61672334, 61902230) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. GK201901010).","Arnberg A.C., van Ommen G.J., Grivell L.A., van Bruggen E.F., Borst P., Some yeast mitochondrial RNAs are circular, Cell, 19, pp. 313-319, (1980); Bao Z., Yang Z., Huang Z., Zhou Y., Cui Q., Dong D., LncRNADisease 2.0: An updated database of long non-coding RNA-associated diseases, Nucleic Acids Res, 47, pp. D1034-d1037, (2019); Bartsch D., Zirkel A., Kurian L., Characterization of circular RNAs (CircRNA) associated with the translation machinery, Methods Mol.

The results showed that circVANGL1 was overexpressed in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines. circVANGL1 expression was closely associated with tumor size, TNM stage and overall survival of NSCLC patients. Further loss-of-function analysis revealed that knockdown of circVANGL1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines. The migration and invasion of NSCLC cells were also suppressed by circVANGL1 knockdown. In addition, we predicted that circVANGL1 might serve as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), becoming a sink for miR-195, thereby modulating the expression of Bcl-2 in NSCLC cells. Rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-195 inhibitor abrogated the beneficial role of circVANGL1 knockdown in NSCLC cells. Taken together, we conclude that circVANGL1 functions as an oncogene to promote NSCLC progression partly through miR-195/Bcl-2 axis, which might be a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC patients. © 2019 The Author(s).","","A549 Cells; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Membrane Proteins; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; RNA Interference; RNA, Circular; RNA, Long Noncoding; Up-Regulation; circular RNA VANGL1; competing endogenous RNA; microRNA; microRNA 195; protein bcl 2; RNA; unclassified drug; BCL2 protein, human; carrier protein; long untranslated RNA; membrane protein; microRNA; MIRN195 microRNA, human; protein bcl 2; VANGL1 protein, human; aged; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; female; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; prediction; protein expression; protein RNA binding; protein targeting; tumor volume; upregulation; A-549 cell line; cell line; cell motion; disease exacerbation; gene expression regulation; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; lung tumor; metabolism; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; RNA interference; tumor cell line; upregulation","","protein bcl 2, 219306-68-0; RNA, 63231-63-0; carrier protein, 80700-39-6; BCL2 protein, human, ; Carrier Proteins, ; Membrane Proteins, ; MicroRNAs, ; MIRN195 microRNA, human, ; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2, ; RNA, Circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ; VANGL1 protein, human, ","","","","","Ettinger D.S., Akerley W., Bepler G., Blum M.G., Chang A., Cheney R.T., Et al., Non-small cell lung cancer, J.

Emerging roles in diverse biological processes suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

However, one fundamental limitation to its use is its relatively short half-life in biological systems. Here we develop exogenous circular RNA (circRNA) to extend the duration of protein expression from full-length RNA messages. First, we engineer a self-splicing intron to efficiently circularize a wide range of RNAs up to 5 kb in length in vitro by rationally designing ubiquitous accessory sequences that aid in splicing. We maximize translation of functional protein from these circRNAs in eukaryotic cells, and we find that engineered circRNA purified by high performance liquid chromatography displays exceptional protein production qualities in terms of both quantity of protein produced and stability of production. This study pioneers the use of exogenous circRNA for robust and stable protein expression in eukaryotic cells and demonstrates that circRNA is a promising alternative to linear mRNA. © 2018 The Author(s).","","Anabaena; Base Sequence; Catalysis; Cell Line; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Eukaryotic Cells; Exons; Genetic Engineering; Humans; Internal Ribosome Entry Sites; Introns; Open Reading Frames; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA; RNA Splicing; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Eukaryota; RNA; messenger RNA; RNA; RNA, circular; cell; eukaryote; gene expression; genetic analysis; genetic engineering; laboratory method; protein; RNA; A-549 cell line; Article; controlled study; eukaryotic cell; female; genetic engineering; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; in vitro study; intron; protein expression; RNA stability; RNA translation; Anabaena; catalysis; cell line; eukaryotic cell; exon; genetic engineering; genetics; internal ribosome entry site; isolation and purification; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; procedures; protein synthesis; RNA splicing; sequence homology","","RNA, 63231-63-0; Internal Ribosome Entry Sites, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Messenger, ","","","National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (T32GM007287); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (W32P4Q-13-1-0011); Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, JDRF, (3-PDF-2017-383-A-N)","This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Grant W32P4Q-13-1-0011).

Although circRNAs are often expressed at low levels, emerging evidence indicates that many circRNAs are linked to physiological development and various diseases. Notably, circRNAs have been shown to serve as oncogenic stimuli or tumor suppressors in cancer. circRNAs may regulate gene expression through different mechanisms. In addition, circRNAs have been shown to be useful as biomarkers of diseases due to their stability, specific expression and relation to diseases both in cells and in extracellular fluid. This review summarizes current knowledge of human circRNAs and discusses the emerging role and clinical implication of these multifarious transcripts. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","biomarker;

They arise from linear precursor RNAs in which 5′ and 3′ ends become covalently ligated. Given these features, biochemical and computational approaches traditionally used to study linear RNA must be adapted for analysis of circular RNAs. Such circRNA-specific methodologies are allowing the systematic identification of circRNAs and the analysis of their biological functions. Here, we review the resources and molecular methods currently utilized to quantify circRNAs, visualize their distribution, identify interacting partners, and elucidate their function. We discuss the challenges of analyzing circRNAs and propose alternative approaches for studying this unique class of transcripts.

A subclass of circRNA was found enriched with miRNA target sites. This evidence suggests that this kind of circRNA functions as natural miRNA sponge. Noticing the potential impacts of circular RNA research, we were motivated to identify novel circRNAs as well as putative circRNA-miRNA interactions through retroactive sourced transcriptome sequencing samples. Results: Through the analysis in 465 RNA-seq runs and 22 reports published in recent years, putatively circRNA sponged miRNA that had been experimentally verified targeting circRNA host gene were found. From this observation, supporting evidence of the competitive endogenous relationship of circRNAs and miRNAs targeting circRNA host genes can be observed. Given the self-regulation and self-induction nature of these circRNAs, this kind of hypothetical phenomenon was hereby called Ouroboros Resembling Competitive Endogenous Loop (ORCEL) in circular RNAs. Conclusions: The fact that miRNA sponge circRNA originated from region miRNA target sites enriched regions, while genes encoded from these regions are conserved to be miRNA targets rationalize the existence of ORCEL. © 2018 The Author(s).","CERNA; CircNet; CircRNA; MiRNA sponge; ORCEL","Algorithms; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; MicroRNAs; RNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; circular RNA; microRNA; RNA; transcriptome; unclassified drug; microRNA; RNA; RNA, circular; Article; autoregulation; binding affinity; circRNA gene; DNA flanking region; exon; gene expression profiling; gene function; gene locus; gene targeting; genetic analysis; human; mathematical analysis; miRNA gene; ORCEL gene; protein protein interaction; RNA sequence; RNA transcription; self induction; sequence analysis; transcription regulation; algorithm; biology; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetic database; genetics; procedures; sequence analysis","","RNA, 63231-63-0; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (106-2633-B-009-001, MOST 106–2633-B-009-001, MOST103-2628-B-009-001-MY3, MOST104-2911-I-009-509, MOST105-2627-M-009-007, MOST105–2319-B-400-002); National Chiao Tung University, NCTU","Funding text 1: Publication charges for this work, is supported by multiple programs from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST103–2628-B-009-001-MY3, MOST105–2627-M-009-007-, MOST105–2319-B-400-002-, MOST104– 2911-I-009-509 and MOST 106–2633-B-009-001].

CircRNAs are generated in the process of back-splicing and can originate from different genomic regions. Their unique circular structure makes circRNAs more stable than linear RNAs. In addition, they also display insensitivity to ribonuclease activity. Generally, circRNAs function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges and have a regulatory role in transcription and translation. They may be also translated in a cap-independent manner in vivo, to generate specific proteins. In the last decade, next-generation sequencing techniques, especially RNA-seq, have revealed great abundance and also dysregulation of many circRNAs in various diseases, suggesting their involvement in disease development and progression. Regarding their high stability and relatively specific differential expression patterns in tissues and extracellular environment (e.g., body fluids), they are regarded as promising novel biomarkers in cancer. Therefore, we focus this review on describing circRNA biogenesis, function, and involvement in human cancer development and address the potential of circRNAs to be effectively used as novel cancer diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

Recently, new classes of ncRNAs, longer than miRNAs have been discovered. Those include intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs). These novel types of ncRNAs opened a very exciting field in biology, leading researchers to discover new relationships between miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which act together to control protein coding gene expression. One of these new discoveries led to the formulation of the “competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis.” This hypothesis suggests that an lncRNA acts as a sponge for miRNAs reducing their expression and causing the upregulation of miRNA targets. In this chapter we first discuss some recent discoveries in this field showing the mutual regulation of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and protein-coding genes in cancer. We then discuss the general approaches for the study of ceRNAs and present in more detail a recent computational approach to explore the ability of lncRNAs to act as ceRNAs in human breast cancer that has been shown to be, among the others, the most precise and promising. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Cancer;

Because of differences in the organization of plant and mammal genomes, the sensitivity and accuracy of circRNA prediction programs using algorithms developed for animals and humans perform poorly for plants. Results: A circRNA prediction software for plants (termed PcircRNA-finder) was developed that is more sensitive in detecting circRNAs than other frequently used programs (such as find-circ and CIRCexplorer), Based on analysis of simulated and real rRNA-/RNAase R RNA-Seq data from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice PcircRNA-finder provides a more comprehensive sensitive, precise prediction method for plants circRNAs. © 2016 The Author Published by Oxford University Press.","","Algorithms; Arabidopsis; Oryza; RNA; RNA, Untranslated; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Software; RNA; RNA, circular; untranslated RNA; algorithm; Arabidopsis; genetics; Oryza; sequence analysis; software","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Untranslated, ","","","","","Chuang T.J., Et al., NCLscan: Accurate identification of non-co-linear transcripts (fusion, trans-splicing and circular RNA) with a good balance between sensitivity and precision, Nucleic Acids Res, 44, (2016); Dobin A., Et al., STAR: Ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner, Bioinformatics, 29, pp. 15-21, (2013); Hansen T.B., Et al., Natural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges, Nature, 495, pp. 384-388, (2013); Hoffmann S., Et al., A multi-split mapping algorithm for circular RNA, splicing, trans-splicing and fusion detection, Genome Biol., 15, (2014); Jeck W.R., Sharpless N.E., Detecting and characterizing circular RNAs, Nat.

CircRNAs have emerged as a vast and novel class of regulatory RNAs with potential to modulate gene expression by acting as sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The biochemical enrichment of circRNAs by exoribonuclease treatment or by depletion of polyadenylated RNAs coupled with deep-sequencing is widely used for the systematic identification of circRNAs. Although these methods enrich circRNAs substantially, they do not eliminate efficiently non-polyadenylated and highly-structured RNAs. Here, we describe a method we termed RPAD, based on initial RNase R treatment followed by Polyadenylation and poly(A)+ RNA Depletion. These joint interventions drastically depleted linear RNAs leading to isolation of highly pure circRNAs from total RNA pools. By facilitating the isolation of highly pure circRNAs, RPAD enables the elucidation of circRNA biogenesis, sequence, and function. © 2018","Backsplice sequence; CircRNAs; Linear RNA depletion; Polyadenylation; RNase R; RT-qPCR","Computational Biology; Exoribonucleases; HeLa Cells; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Poly A; Polyadenylation; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Binding Proteins; Sequence Analysis, RNA; circular RNA; exoribonuclease; messenger RNA; RNA; RNA binding protein; small nuclear RNA; unclassified drug; exoribonuclease; HIPK3 protein, human; nuclear protein; polyadenylic acid; protein serine threonine kinase; ribonuclease R; RNA; RNA binding protein; RNA, circular; signal peptide; SPECC1 protein, human; adaptation; Article; biochemistry; biogenesis; depletion; high throughput sequencing; human; nonhuman; polyadenylation; priority journal; protein RNA binding; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; RNA degradation; RNA depletion; RNA isolation; RNA sequence; RNA structure; signal transduction; biology; genetics; HeLa cell line; isolation and purification; metabolism; polyadenylation; procedures; sequence analysis","","exoribonuclease, 37288-24-7; RNA, 63231-63-0; polyadenylic acid, 24937-83-5; protein serine threonine kinase, ; Exoribonucleases, ; HIPK3 protein, human, ; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, ; Nuclear Proteins, ; Poly A, ; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases, ; ribonuclease R, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Messenger, ; RNA-Binding Proteins, ; SPECC1 protein, human, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA; Life Sciences Institute, LSI; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DBT; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB; Department of Science and Technology, Government of Rajasthan, DST","Funding text 1: PP, ACP, and MG were supported by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

Here, we used an exome capture RNA sequencing protocol to detect and characterize circRNAs across >2,000 cancer samples. When compared against Ribo-Zero and RNase R, capture sequencing significantly enhanced the enrichment of circRNAs and preserved accurate circular-to-linear ratios. Using capture sequencing, we built the most comprehensive catalog of circRNA species to date: MiOncoCirc, the first database to be composed primarily of circRNAs directly detected in tumor tissues. Using MiOncoCirc, we identified candidate circRNAs to serve as biomarkers for prostate cancer and were able to detect circRNAs in urine. We further detected a novel class of circular transcripts, termed read-through circRNAs, that involved exons originating from different genes. MiOncoCirc will serve as a valuable resource for the development of circRNAs as diagnostic or therapeutic targets across cancer types. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.; MiOncoCirc provides a reference of the circular RNA landscape across 40 cancer types. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","biomarkers; cancer; circRNA; circRNA database; exome capture sequencing; non-coding RNA; read-through transcripts","Biomarkers, Tumor; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Whole Exome Sequencing; cell free nucleic acid; circular RNA; complementary DNA; DNA fragment; ribonuclease; RNA; unclassified drug; microRNA; RNA; RNA, circular; tumor marker; adult; Article; cancer tissue; clinical article; clinical protocol; controlled study; exon; genetic database; human; human cell; human tissue; male; priority journal; prostate cancer; RNA analysis; RNA probe; RNA sequence; urine; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; neoplasm; procedures; sequence analysis; whole exome sequencing","","ribonuclease, 59794-03-5, 9001-99-4; RNA, 63231-63-0; Biomarkers, Tumor, ; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ","","","CPTAC; Early Detection Research Network, (P50 CA097186, P50 CA186786, U01 CA214170); Michigan Center for Translational Pathology; National Cancer Institute Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD, (PC160429, W81XWH-16-1-0195, W81XWH-17-1-0134); Howard Hughes Medical Institute, HHMI; American Cancer Society, ACS; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R35CA231996, U01CA214170, U24CA210967); Prostate Cancer Foundation, PCF; Pediatric Cancer Foundation, PCF; National Computational Infrastructure, NCI","Funding text 1: We gratefully acknowledge all patients who participated in these studies.

In cardiovascular diseases, the role of specific families of RNA transcripts belonging to the group of the non-coding RNAs started to be unveiled in the last two decades. The knowledge of the functional rules and roles of non-coding RNAs in the context of cardiovascular diseases is an important factor to derive new diagnostic methods, but also to design targeted therapeutic strategies. The characterization and analysis of ncRNA function requires a deep knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of these RNA species that often relies on intricated interaction networks. The use of specific bioinformatic tools to interrogate biological data and to derive functional implications is particularly relevant and needs to be extended to the general practice of translational researchers. This chapter briefly summarizes the bioinformatic tools and strategies that could be used for the characterization and functional analysis of non-coding RNAs, with special emphasis in their applications to the cardiovascular field. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Analytical methods;

Models of circRNAs synthesis and function are emerging but much remains undefined about this surprisingly prevalent class of RNA. Here, we identified exonic circRNAs from human and mouse RNA-sequencing datasets, documenting multiple new examples. Addressing function, we found that many circRNAs co-sediment with ribosomes, indicative of their translation potential. By contrast, circRNAs with potential to act as microRNA sponges were scarce, with some support for a collective sponge function by groups of circRNAs. Addressing circRNA biogenesis, we delineated several features commonly associated with circRNA occurrence. CircRNA-producing genes tend to be longer and to contain more exons than average. Back-splice acceptor exons are strongly enriched at ordinal position 2 within genes, and circRNAs typically have a short exon span with two exons being the most prevalent. The flanking introns either side of circRNA loci are exceptionally long. Of note also, single-exon circRNAs derive from unusually long exons while multi-exon circRNAs are mostly generated from exons of regular length. These findings independently validate and extend similar observations made in a number of prior studies. Furthermore, we analysed high-resolution RNA polymerase II occupancy data from two separate human cell lines to reveal distinctive transcription dynamics at circRNA-producing genes. Specifically, RNA polymerase II traverses the introns of these genes at above average speed concomitant with an accentuated slow-down at exons. Collectively, these features indicate how a perturbed balance between transcription and linear splicing creates important preconditions for circRNA production. We speculate that these preconditions need to be in place so that looping interactions between flanking introns can promote back-splicing to raise circRNA production to appreciable levels. © 2019, The Author(s).","","Alternative Splicing; Animals; Base Sequence; Databases, Genetic; Exons; Humans; Introns; Mice; MicroRNAs; RNA; RNA Splicing; RNA, Circular; microRNA; RNA; alternative RNA splicing; animal; biosynthesis; exon; genetic database; genetics; human; intron; metabolism; mouse; nucleotide sequence; RNA splicing","","RNA, 63231-63-0; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Australian Research Council, (DP130101928, DP180100111); National Health and Medical Research Council, (GNT1126711)","This work was supported by project grant funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia to G.J.G. and T.P.

Although circular RNAs have been known for a long time, it is only recently that their therapeutic implications are being investigated. Research has shown that they are suitable candidates to be genetic biomarkers for different types of cancer since they are implied in Carcinogenesis. However, their identification involves a computationally intensive and very long process. This represents a serious obstacle to their ability to provide a fast and accurate life-saving diagnosis. Here we present Circular RNA FPGA Aligner (circFa), a hardware implementation of an alignment algorithm designed for the circular RNAs identification protocol. Our solution aims to reduce diagnosis time and produces a pharmacological therapy tailored to the specific patient using his genetic information. CircFA implements the same scalable version of the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm with affine gaps employed by Bowtie2, a state of the art tool for sequence alignment, on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Our design shows a speedup over the software version of SW of 8.8x, and a speedup of 1.95x over a parallelized multicore version of the same software. Our architecture also shows a significant increase in power efficiency with an increase of 80.96x and 17.96x with respect to the single core and multicore software respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","","Bioinformatics; Genes; Medical informatics; Patient treatment; RNA; Alignment algorithms; Genetic information; Hardware implementations; Identification protocol; Power efficiency; Sequence alignments; Software versions; State of the art; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","","","","","","","Ramaswamy S., Tamayo P., Rifkin R., Mukherjee S., Yeang C.-H., Angelo M., Ladd C., Reich M., Latulippe E., Mesirov J.P., Et al., Multiclass cancer diagnosis using tumor gene expression signatures, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98, 26, pp. 15149-15154, (2001); Henson D.E., Srivastava S., Kramer B.S., Molecular and genetic targets in early detection, Current Opinion in Oncology, 11, 5, (1999); NIH National Cancer Institute; Meng S., Zhou H., Feng Z., Xu Z., Tang Y., Li P., Wu M., Circrna: Functions and properties of a novel potential biomarker for cancer, Molecular Cancer, 16, 1, (2017); Rong D., Sun H., Li Z., Liu S., Dong C., Fu K., Tang W., Cao H., An emerging function of circrna-mirnas-mRNA axis in human diseases, Oncotarget, 8, 42, (2017); Lukiw W.J., Circular RNA (circRNA) in alzheimers disease (ad), Front Genet, 4, 4, (2013); Okholm T.L.H., Nielsen M.M., Hamilton M.P., Christensen L.-L., Vang S., Hedegaard J., Hansen T.B., Kjems J., Dyrskjot L., Pedersen J.S., Circular RNA expression is abundant and correlated to aggressiveness in early-stage bladder cancer, NPJ Genomic Medicine, 2, 1, (2017); Kun-Peng Z., Xiao-Long M., Chun-Lin Z., Overexpressed circpvt1, a potential new circular RNA biomarker, contributes to doxorubicin and cisplatin resistance of osteosarcoma cells by regulating abcb1, International Journal of Biological Sciences, 14, 3; Conn S.J., Pillman K.A., Toubia J., Conn V.M., Salmanidis M., Phillips C.A., Roslan S., Schreiber A.W., Gregory P.A., Goodall G.J., The RNA binding protein quaking regulates formation of circRNAs, Cell, 160, 6, pp. 1125-1134, (2015); Hansen T.B., Kjems J., Damgaard C.K., Circular RNA and MIR-7 in cancer, Cancer Research, 73, 18, pp. 5609-5612, (2013); Kim D., Pertea G., Trapnell C., Pimentel H., Kelley R., Salzberg S.L., Tophat2: Accurate alignment of transcriptomes in the presence of insertions, deletions and gene fusions, Genome Biology, 14, 4, (2013); Identification of common molecular subsequence, Mol.

Here, we develop a web-accessible database (http://www.exoRBase.org), exoRBase, which is a repository of circular RNA (circRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from RNA-seq data analyses of human blood exosomes. Experimental validations from the published literature are also included. exoRBase features the integration and visualization of RNA expression profiles based on normalized RNA-seq data spanning both normal individuals and patients with different diseases. exoRBase aims to collect and characterize all long RNA species in human blood exosomes. The first release of exoRBase contains 58 330 circRNAs, 15 501 lncRNAs and 18 333 mRNAs. The annotation, expression level and possible original tissues are provided. exoRBase will aid researchers in identifying molecular signatures in blood exosomes and will trigger new exosomal biomarker discovery and functional implication for human diseases. © The Author(s) 2017.

However, the mechanisms regulating the functions of AGO2 in cancer still remain elusive. Herein, we indentify one intronic circular RNA (circRNA) generated from AGO2 gene (circAGO2) as a novel regulator of AGO2-miRNA complexes and cancer progression. CircAGO2 is up-regulated in gastric cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and neuroblastoma, and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. CircAGO2 promotes the growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies reveal that circAGO2 physically interacts with human antigen R (HuR) protein to facilitate its activation and enrichment on the 3’-untranslated region of target genes, resulting in reduction of AGO2 binding and repression of AGO2/miRNA-mediated gene silencing associated with cancer progression. Pre-clinically, administration of lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA targeting circAGO2 inhibits the expression of downstream target genes, and suppresses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of xenografts in nude mice. In addition, blocking the interaction between circAGO2 and HuR by cell-penetrating inhibitory peptide represses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of cancer cells. Taken together, these results indicate that oncogenic circAGO2 drives cancer progression through facilitating HuR-repressed functions of AGO2-miRNA complexes. © 2018, ADMC Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare.","","Algorithms; Animals; Argonaute Proteins; Cell Movement; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; ELAV-Like Protein 1; Female; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; Neoplasms, Experimental; RNA, Circular; cell penetrating peptide; circular RNA circAGO2; microRNA; protein; protein human antigen R; RNA; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; AGO2 protein, human; argonaute protein; ELAV like protein 1; ELAVL1 protein, human; microRNA; 3' untranslated region; AGO2 gene; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; carcinogenesis; colon cancer; controlled study; embryo; female; gene activation; gene expression; gene repression; gene silencing; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; Lentivirus; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; metastasis; mouse; neuroblastoma; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein binding; protein interaction; RNA analysis; stomach cancer; tumor invasion; tumor xenograft; upregulation; algorithm; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell culture; cell motion; cell survival; experimental neoplasm; genetics; HEK293 cell line; mass spectrometry; metabolism; neoplasm; nude mouse; pathology","","protein, 67254-75-5; RNA, 63231-63-0; AGO2 protein, human, ; Argonaute Proteins, ; ELAV-Like Protein 1, ; ELAVL1 protein, human, ; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81272779, 81372667, 81402301, 81402408, 81472363, 81572423, 81672500, 81772967, 81773094, 81802925, 81874066, 81874085); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2014CFA012); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2012QN224, 2013ZHYX003)","Acknowledgements We appreciate Drs.

Objective Purpose of the present study was to investigate circRNA expression in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Methods A total of six cSCC and six non-lesional skin (control) biopsies were harvested. Microarray based circRNA expression was determined in the cSCC (n = 3) and compared with the non-lesional skin (n = 3) from a group of 13,617 distinct human circRNAs found in the Arraystar circRNA Array V2.0 (Arraystar, Rockville, USA). Microarray data were validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in a separate group (cSCC, n = 3 and non-lesional skin, n = 3). miRNA binding to miRNA response elements (MREs) sequence data were acquired bioinformatically. Further data mining was performed to identify circRNAs containing MRE sequences that interacted with previously described miRNAs playing a role in cSCC formation. Results A total of 322 circRNAs (143 up- and 179 down-regulated; fold change ≥2 and p < 0.05) were identified as differentially expressed in cSCC. Furthermore, we identified a total of 1603 MREs that were part of the differentially expressed circRNAs. Among those circRNAs, a complementary MRE sequence was identified in 23 miRNAs previously known to be cSCC relevant. Conclusion This study showed that circRNAs are differentially expressed in cSCC and play an important role in tumor formation by interfering with cSCC relevant miRNAs through miRNA sequence complementary MREs participating in epigenetic control. © 2016 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology","CircularRNAs; Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; MicroRNAs; Non-coding RNAs","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA; RNA, Neoplasm; Skin Neoplasms; circular RNA; microRNA; RNA; unclassified drug; microRNA; RNA; RNA, circular; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; bioinformatics; clinical article; controlled study; data mining; down regulation; female; gene expression; gene expression regulation; human; human tissue; male; microarray analysis; middle aged; priority journal; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA binding; RNA response element; RNA structure; sequence analysis; skin carcinoma; upregulation; very elderly; biology; case control study; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; genetic database; genetics; pathology; procedures; skin tumor; squamous cell carcinoma","","RNA, 63231-63-0; Biomarkers, Tumor, ; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Neoplasm, ","","","Heed Ophthalmic Foundation, HOF","All authors hereby disclose any commercial associations that may pose or create a conflict of interest with the information presented in this manuscript.

One large subgroup of non-coding RNAs is the recently discovered class of circular RNAs (circRNAs). CircRNAs are conserved and expressed in a tissue and developmental specific manner, although for the vast majority, the functional relevance remains unclear. To identify and quantify circRNAs expression, several bioinformatic pipelines have been developed to assess the catalog of circRNAs in any given total RNA sequencing dataset. We recently compared five different algorithms for circRNA detection, but here this analysis is extended to 11 algorithms. By comparing the number of circRNAs discovered and their respective sensitivity to RNaseR digestion, the sensitivity and specificity of each algorithm are evaluated. Moreover, the ability to predict de novo circRNA, i.e., circRNAs not derived from annotated splice sites, is also determined as well as the effect of eliminating low quality and adaptor-containing reads prior to circRNA prediction. Finally, and most importantly, all possible pair-wise combinations of algorithms are tested and guidelines for algorithm complementarity are provided. Conclusively, the algorithms mostly agree on highly expressed circRNAs, however, in many cases, algorithm-specific false positives with high read counts are predicted, which is resolved by using the shared output from two (or more) algorithms. © 2018 Hansen.","Bioinformatics; Circular RNA; Combining algorithms; Gene prediction; Non-coding RNA","","","","","","","","Cheng J., Metge F., Dieterich C., Specific identification and quantification of circular RNAs from sequencing data, Bioinformatics, 32, pp. 1094-1096, (2016); Gao Y., Wang J., Zhao F., CIRI: an efficient and unbiased algorithm for de novo circular RNA identification, Genome Biol, 16, (2015); Gao Y., Zhang J., Zhao F., Circular RNA identification based on multiple seed matching, Brief.

Most circRNAs are presented with characteristics of abundance, stability, conservatism, and often exhibiting tissue/developmentalstage- specific expression. CircRNAs are generated either from exons or introns by back splicing or lariat introns. CircRNAs play important roles as miRNA sponges, gene transcription and expression regulators, RNA-binding protein (RBP) sponges and protein/peptide translators. Emerging evidence revealed the function of circRNAs in cancer and may potentially serve as a required novel biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In this review, we discuss about the origins, characteristics and functions of circRNA and how they work as miRNA sponges, gene transcription and expression regulators, RBP sponges in cancer as well as current research methods of circRNAs, providing evidence for the significance of circRNAs in cancer diagnosis and clinical treatment. © Han et al.","Biomarkers; Cancer; Circular RNAs; Gene transcription; MicroRNA sponges","circular RNA; microRNA; RNA binding protein; tumor marker; unclassified drug; gene expression regulation; genetic analysis; genetic marker; human; malignant neoplasm; microarray analysis; Review; RNA sequence; RNA translation; transcription regulation","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31570775, 81602469)","This work was, in part, supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81602469) (to W-LI), and Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31570775) (to JH-Z).","Djebali S., Davis C.A., Merkel A., Dobin A., Lassmann T., Mortazavi A., Tanzer A., Lagarde J., Lin W., Schlesinger F., Xue C., Marinov G.K., Khatun J., Et al., Landscape of transcription in human cells, Nature, 489, pp. 101-108, (2012); Memczak S., Jens M., Elefsinioti A., Torti F., Krueger J., Rybak A., Maier L., Mackowiak S.D., Gregersen L.H., Munschauer M., Loewer A., Ziebold U., Landthaler M., Et al., Circular RNAs are a large class of animal RNAs with regulatory potency, Nature, 495, pp. 333-338, (2013); Chen L.L., Yang L., Regulation of circRNA biogenesis, RNA Biol, 12, (2015); Nigro J.M., Cho K.R., Fearon E.R., Kern S.E., Ruppert J.M., Oliner J.D., Kinzler K.W., Vogelstein B., Scrambled exons, Cell, 64, pp. 607-613, (1991); Cocquerelle C., Mascrez B., Hetuin D., Bailleul B., Missplicing yields circular RNA molecules, FASEB J, 7, pp. 155-160, (1993); Hansen T.B., Jensen T.I., Clausen B.H., Bramsen J.B., Finsen B., Damgaard C.K., Kjems J., Natural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges, Nature, 495, pp. 384-388, (2013); Jeck W.R., Sorrentino J.A., Wang K., Slevin M.K., Burd C.E., Liu J., Marzluff W.F., Sharpless N.E., Circular RNAs are abundant, conserved, and associated with ALU repeats, RNA, 19, pp. 141-157, (2013); Salzman J., Chen R.E., Olsen M.N., Wang P.L., Brown P.O., Cell-type specific features of circular RNA expression, PLoS Genet, 9, (2013); Zhang Y., Zhang X.O., Chen T., Xiang J.F., Yin Q.F., Xing Y.H., Zhu S., Yang L., Chen L.L., Circular Intronic Long Noncoding RNAs, Mol Cell, 51, pp. 792-806, (2013); Li Z., Huang C., Bao C., Chen L., Lin M., Wang X., Zhong G., Yu B., Hu W., Dai L., Zhu P., Chang Z., Wu Q., Et al., Exonintron circular RNAs regulate transcription in the nucleus, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 22, pp. 256-264, (2015); You X., Vlatkovic I., Babic A., Will T., Epstein I., Tushev G., Akbalik G., Wang M., Glock C., Quedenau C., Wang X., Hou J., Liu H., Et al., Neural circular RNAs are derived from syn¬aptic genes and regulated by development and plasticity, Nat Neurosci, 18, pp. 603-610, (2015); Li F., Zhang L., Li W., Deng J., Zheng J., An M., Lu J., Zhou Y., Circular RNA ITCH has inhibitory effect on ESCC by suppressing the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, Oncotarget, 6, pp. 6001-6013, (2015); Xie H., Ren X., Xin S., Lan X., Lu G., Lin Y., Yang S., Zeng Z., Liao W., Ding Y.Q., Liang L., Emerging roles of circRNA_001569 targeting miR-145 in the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer, Oncotarget, 7, pp. 26680-26691, (2016); Li P., Chen S., Chen H., Mo X., Li T., Shao Y., Xiao B., Guo J., Using circular RNA as a novel type of biomarker in the screening of gastric cancer, Clin Chim Acta, 444, pp. 132-136, (2015); Wilusz J.E., Sharp P.A., Molecular biology.

However, the expression of circRNAs in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely unknown so far. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve bone marrow samples from pediatric AML patients and healthy controls were analyzed using Agilent circRNA microarray (n = 6, respectively). The circRNAs profiles and regulatory networks were analyzed by integrated bioinformatics methods. Functional analysis (Gene Ontology and KEGG) was performed by KOBAS. The expression of circRNA in patient samples was validated via qRT-PCR assay (n > 30). Luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate the binding of miRNAs. CCK8 and colony formation assay were conducted to measure cell proliferation. RESULTS: A total of 273 circRNAs were upregulated in AML and 296 were downregulated (Fold change > 2, p-value < 0.05), the majority of these circRNAs were distributed among chr1, chr6, and chr16, while few in chr13 and chr21. Top 20 differentially expressed circRNAs were chosen to build circRNAs-miRNAs regulatory relationships. Bioinformatics algorithms indicated that circ-0004136 acts as a sponge for several pediatric AML-related miRNAs. Target genes involved in the circ0004136-miRNA-mRNA network were enriched in leukemia-related functions and signaling pathways. Circ-0004136 was found to be significantly upregulated in pediatric AML and could sponge AML-related miRNAs, including miR-29a and miR-142. Furthermore, circ-0004136 was demonstrated to promote the proliferation of AML by sponging miR-142. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study revealed the circRNAs expression profile and regulatory networks of circRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs in pediatric AML for the first time. Circ-0004136 was significantly upregulated in pediatric AML and could promote cell proliferation by sponging miR-142. © 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

However, experimental methods of circRNA prediction remain expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is urgent to propose novel computational methods for the prediction of circRNA-disease associations. In this study, we develop a computational method called LLCDC that integrates the known circRNA-disease associations, circRNA semantic similarity network, disease semantic similarity network, reconstructed circRNA similarity network, and reconstructed disease similarity network to predict circRNAs related to human diseases. Specifically, the reconstructed similarity networks are obtained by using Locality-Constrained Linear Coding (LLC) on the known association matrix, cosine similarities of circRNAs and diseases. Then, the label propagation method is applied to the similarity networks, and four relevant score matrices are respectively obtained. Finally, we use 5-fold cross validation (5-fold CV) to evaluate the performance of LLCDC, and the AUC value of the method is 0.9177, indicating that our method performs better than the other three methods. In addition, case studies on gastric cancer, breast cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma further verify the reliability of our method in predicting disease-associated circRNAs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Association prediction; circRNA; Cosine similarity; Disease; Label propagation; Locality-constrained linear coding","Algorithms; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Neoplasms; RNA, Circular; circular ribonucleic acid; Article; breast cancer; computer model; directed acyclic graph; disease association; down regulation; human; locality constrained linear coding; mathematical analysis; prediction; priority journal; stomach cancer; thyroid papillary carcinoma; upregulation; algorithm; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; neoplasm; procedures","","RNA, Circular, ","","","Doctor Startup Foundation from Liaoning Province, (20170520217); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61702344)","This work was supported by the Doctor Startup Foundation from Liaoning Province under Grant No. 20170520217 , the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No: 61702344 ).

They are generated through alternative splicing events and widely expressed from human to viruses. CircRNAs have been appointed as potential regulators of microRNAs (miRNAs), RNA-binding proteins (RPBs), and lineal protein-coding transcripts. Although their mechanism of action remains unclear, the deregulation of circular RNAs has been confirmed in different diseases such as Alzheimer or cancer. The introduction of high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology provides millions of short RNA sequences at single-nucleotide level, allowing an accurate and proficient method to measure circular RNAs. Novel protocols based on non-polyadenylated RNAs, rRNA-depleted, and RNA exonuclease-based enrichment approaches (RNase R) have taken even further the possibility of detecting circRNAs. Besides, the identification of circRNAs presence requires the development of specific bioinformatics tools to detect junction-spanning sequences from transcriptome deep-sequencing samples. Thus, recently established bioinformatics’ approaches have permitted the discovery of an elevated number of different circRNAs in diverse organisms. In that sense, recent studies have compared different methods and advocate the simultaneous use of more than one prediction tool. For that reason, we want to highlight pipelines such as miARma-Seq that is able to execute various circular RNA identification algorithms in an easy way, without the tedious installation of third-party prerequisites. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","CircRNA prediction tools;

Based on their components, circRNAs are divided into exonic circRNAs, intronic circRNAs, and exon-intron circRNAs. CircRNAs have well-conserved sequences and often have high stability due to their resistance to exonucleases. Depending on their sequence, circRNAs are involved in different biological functions, including microRNA sponge activity, modulation of alternative splicing or transcription, interaction with RNA-binding proteins, and rolling translation, and are a derivative of pseudogenes. CircRNAs are involved in the development of a variety of pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurological diseases, and cancer. Emerging evidence has shown that circRNAs are likely to be new potential clinical diagnostic markers or treatments for many diseases. Here we describe circRNA research methods and biological functions, and discuss the potential relationship between circRNAs and disease progression. © 2018 Xu et al.","CircRNA; Database; Diseases; Marker","biological marker; circular RNA; exonuclease; messenger RNA; microRNA; RNA; RNA binding protein; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; aging; apoptosis; Article; atherosclerosis; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; cardiovascular disease; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; diabetes mellitus; disease course; disease exacerbation; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; gene expression; genetic transcription; heart infarction; high throughput sequencing; human; liver cell carcinoma; malignant neoplasm; neurologic disease; polymerase chain reaction; protein expression; RNA analysis; RNA purification; RNA splicing; signal transduction; stomach cancer; uterine cervix cancer","","exonuclease, 37228-74-3; RNA, 63231-63-0","","","Shandong Province Natural Science Outstanding Youth Fund; National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China, IUSS, (81522005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (2016JQB01015, 81470522, 81500222); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2017M612213)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Fund Project (81522005); National Natural Science Foundation of China (81470522); National Natural Science Foundation of China (81500222); Shandong Province Natural Science Outstanding Youth Fund (2016JQB01015); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017M612213).

These noncoding RNA transcripts are known to affect expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) via epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation. Given their widespread target spectrum, as well as extensive modes of action, a complete understanding of their biological relevance will depend on integrative analyses of systems data at various levels. Findings: While a handful of publicly available databases have been reported, existing tools do not fully capture, from a network perspective, the functional implications of lncRNAs or circRNAs of interest. Through an integrated and streamlined design, circlncRNAnet aims to broaden the understanding of ncRNA candidates by testing in silico several hypotheses of ncRNA-based functions, on the basis of large-scale RNA-seq data. This web server is implemented with several features that represent advances in the bioinformatics of ncRNAs: (1) a flexible framework that accepts and processes user-defined next-generation sequencing-based expression data; (2) multiple analytic modules that assign and productively assess the regulatory networks of user-selected ncRNAs by cross-referencing extensively curated databases; (3) an all-purpose, information-rich workflow design that is tailored to all types of ncRNAs. Outputs on expression profiles, co-expression networks and pathways, and molecular interactomes, are dynamically and interactively displayed according to user-defined criteria.

However, there is lack of comprehensively annotated human circular RNAs database. In this study we established a circRNA database, named as circRNADb, containing 32,914 human exonic circRNAs carefully selected from diversified sources. The detailed information of the circRNA, including genomic information, exon splicing, genome sequence, internal ribosome entry site (IRES), open reading frame (ORF) and references were provided in circRNADb. In addition, circRNAs were found to be able to encode proteins, which have not been reported in any species. 16328 circRNAs were annotated to have ORF longer than 100 amino acids, of which 7170 have IRES elements. 46 circRNAs from 37 genes were found to have their corresponding proteins expressed according mass spectrometry. The database provides the function of data search, browse, download, submit and feedback for the user to study particular circular RNA of interest and update the database continually. circRNADb will be built to be a biological information platform for circRNA molecules and related biological functions in the future.

For mammals, the skeletal muscle development depends on the growth and differentiation of embryonic myocyte, which has a significant impact on the subsequent growing potential. In this study, the developmental mode of skeletal muscle, the important transformation nodes, the formation of muscle fibers and the molecular regulation mechanism of transformation were mainly explored. 【Method】 Based on the previous research, the important nodes D85, D105 and D135 related to the myotube development were used in the experiment, and the longissimus dorsi muscles were sequenced by whole transcriptome sequencing. The differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were screened by bioinformatics analysis and verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). 【Result】 1 126 DE circRNAs were obtained by conditional screening (|log2| ≥1 and P≤0.05). The 3 groups were compared and many specific expressions of circRNA were found at each stage, but in the D85 vs D135 group, the amount was the most. 374 DE circRNAs were obtained, which contained 201 up-regulated and 173 down-regulated, and 44.7% of the DE genes were differentially expressed with a difference of more than 4 times. These DE circRNAs were subjected to run GO and KEGG functional analysis and targeted prediction, and they were enriched into some pathways, such as energy metabolism and signal transduction, which involved in muscle differentiation and muscle fiber development, including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, Ras, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and other signal transduction pathways. According to the results, it was confirmed that the DE circRNAs enriched during D85 to D105 were mostly associated with cell proliferation and survival, regulation of myocyte development and cell cycle, while D105 to D135 were mainly related to energy conversion, material transport, RNA transport, and DNA repair. By drawing co-expression visualization network with the targeted prediction results used by Cytoscape, the core regulatory transcripts, such as circRNA8239, circRNA19073, circRNA2765 and circRNA1616, were identified. In the D105 period, a key factor circRNA7527 that regulated the conversion of fast and slow muscle types was found, which targets the bta-miR-135a, bta-miR-615, and chi-miR-133a-5p to regulate the MEF2C gene. According to the differential expression and functional prediction in three comparison groups, 4 circRNAs related to muscle development and 4 target miRNA were selected for qRT-PCR, and the results showed that the gene expression trend was consistent with the sequencing data. 【Conclusion】 It was verified that the stabilization of the number of muscle fibers occurred between sheep embryos at D85 and D105, and muscle fiber hypertrophy happened during the D105 to D135 period, which lead to the conclusion that D105 was probably a key time point. In this study, we firstly constructed a circRNA map in sheep embryonic skeletal muscle development based on the whole transcriptome sequencing. The transcriptome differences at key stages were revealed, and multiple circRNAs and miRNAs targeting MEF2C that involved in the MAPK signaling pathway were found, which provided reference for livestock myofiber development research and other research on non-coding RNA. © 2020 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

Here, we provide a resource of circRNA expression in a comprehensive panel of 60 lung cancer and non-transformed cell lines (FL3C dataset). RNA sequencing after depletion of ribosomal RNA quantified the expression of circRNA and linear RNA. We detected 148,811 circular RNAs quantified by 2.8 million backsplicing reads originating from 12,251 genes. The number of identified circRNAs was markedly higher using rRNA depletion compared to public polyA-enriched RNA-seq datasets. CircRNAs almost never started in the first exon nor ended in the last exon and started more frequently in earlier exons. Most circRNAs showed high cell line specificity and correlated positively with their linear RNA counterpart. Known cancer genes produced more circRNAs than non-cancer genes. Subsets of circRNAs correlated with cell proliferation, histological subtype or genotype. CircTNFRSF21 was translated crossing the backsplice site in two different reading frames. Overexpression of circPVT1, circERBB2, circHIPK3, circCCNB1, circSMAD2, circTNFRSF21 and circKIF5B significantly increased colony formation. In conclusion, our data provide a comprehensive map of circRNA expression in lung cancer cells and global patterns of circRNA production as a useful resource for future research into lung cancer circRNAs. © 2020 by the authors.

It is found to be evolutionary conservative and stable with tissue specificity. CircRNAs have many biological functions. In addition to acting as miRNA sponges, many other functions are being revealed, including regulator of gene transcription, and splicing and protein translation. It is involved in ovarian epithelial neoplasms, pre-eclampsia and other development. CircRNAs could regulate the expression of numerous gynecological cancer-related microRNA (miRNAs). The circRNA-miRNA-messenger RNA(mRNA) axis is a known regulatory pattern of several cancer-associated pathways, with both agonist and antagonist effects on carcinogenesis. Numerous studies have shown that circRNAs may become potential targets and clinical diagnostic markers for reproductive and gynecological diseases. This review focuses on the biogenesis and properties of circRNAs, databases of circRNA,their functions and potential significance in gestational, tumor and gestational diseases.

CircRNAs are widely present in eukaryotic cells with the capabilities of structural stability, high abundance and cell-/tissue-specific expression. A growing body of researches suggest that the dysregulated circRNAs are intimately relevant to the occurrence and development of cancer. In this review, we mainly discuss the differentially expressed circRNAs in cancer tissues, plasma and exosomes, which makes it possible for clinicians to use certain circRNAs as novel biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In particular, we primarily focus on circRNAs as potential therapeutic targets, which will provide promising applications in cancer gene therapy. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","Biomarkers; Cancer; CircRNAs; Circulating RNAs; Differential expression; Exosomes; Therapeutic target","Biomarkers, Tumor; Exosomes; Humans; Neoplasms; Prognosis; RNA, Circular; biological marker; circular RNA; focal adhesion kinase; microRNA; protein serine threonine kinase; transcription factor FKHRL1; tumor marker; unclassified drug; tumor marker; bioinformatics; bladder cancer; cancer growth; cancer therapy; cell cycle progression; cell migration; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; CRISPR-CAS9 system; down regulation; gene expression; gene overexpression; gene sequence; gene therapy; human; in situ hybridization; Kaplan Meier method; liver cell carcinoma; malignant neoplasm; osteosarcoma; pancreas adenocarcinoma; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; receiver operating characteristic; recurrence free survival; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; sensitivity and specificity; stomach cancer; tumor gene; tumor volume; upregulation; exosome; genetics; neoplasm; prognosis","","protein serine threonine kinase, ; Biomarkers, Tumor, ; RNA, Circular, ","","","National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, (201711646018); Non-profit Technology Research Program of Zhejiang, (LGF18H160006); Scientific Innovation Team Project of Ningbo, (2017 C110019); Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo, (2017A610247, 2018A610204); Ningbo University, NBU; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LQ18H200001)","This work was supported in part by research grants from the Non-profit Technology Research Program of Zhejiang (LGF18H160006), the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang (LQ18H200001), the Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo (2018A610204, 2017A610247), the Scientific Innovation Team Project of Ningbo (2017 C110019), the National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (201711646018) and the K.C·Wong Magna Fund in Ningbo University.","Dunham I., Kundaje A., Aldred S.F., Et al., An integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome, Nature, 489, 7414, pp. 57-74, (2012); Hsu M.T., Coca-Prados M., Electron microscopic evidence for the circular form of RNA in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, Nature, 280, 5720, pp. 339-340, (1979); Arnberg A.C., Van Ommen G.J., Grivell L.A., Van Bruggen E.F., Borst P., Some yeast mitochondrial RNAs are circular, Cell, 19, 2, pp. 313-319, (1980); Cocquerelle C., Mascrez B., Hetuin D., Bailleul B., Mis-splicing yields circular RNA molecules, Faseb J, 7, 1, pp. 155-160, (1993); Nigro J.M., Cho K.R., Fearon E.R., Et al., Scrambled Exons.

In addition to their potential as major gene regulators, reports are linking heterogeneous circRNA groups with many different human disorders, especially cancer. In this review, we focus on the rapidly advancing field of circRNAs that play a part in human diseases. We list tools (eg, public databases) that scan genome spans of interest to identify known circRNAs; describe the relationship between dysregulated circRNAs and human disease, highlighting their specific roles; and consider the possible use of current and potential circRNA research applications in treating human diseases. Specifically, we review the role of circRNAs as biomarkers, drug targets and therapeutic agents.","","Animals; Biomarkers; Disease; Humans; RNA; biological marker; circular rna; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA;

However, little is known about the functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs and circRNAs in self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells. Therefore, we explored the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs in male and female mouse germline stem cells by high-throughput sequencing. We identified 18573 novel lncRNAs and 18822 circRNAs in the germline stem cells and further confirmed the existence of these lncRNAs and circRNAs by RT-PCR. The results showed that male and female germline stem cells had similar GDNF signaling mechanism. Subsequently, 8115 mRNAs, 3996 lncRNAs, and 921 circRNAs exhibited sex-biased expression that may be associated with germline stem cell acquisition of the sex-specific properties required for differentiation into gametes. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed different functions for these sex-biased lncRNAs and circRNAs. We further constructed correlated expression networks including coding-noncoding co-expression and competing endogenous RNAs with bioinformatics. Co-expression analysis showed hundreds of lncRNAs were correlated with sex differences in mouse germline stem cells, including lncRNA Gm11851, lncRNA Gm12840, lncRNA 4930405O22Rik, and lncRNA Atp10d. CeRNA network inferred that lncRNA Meg3 and cirRNA Igf1r could bind competitively with miRNA-15a-5p increasing target gene Inha, Acsl3, Kif21b, and Igfbp2 expressions. These findings provide novel perspectives on lncRNAs and circRNAs and lay a foundation for future research into the regulating mechanisms of lncRNAs and circRNAs in germline stem cells.","CeRNA; CircRNA; Female germline stem cell; LncRNA; Spermatogonial stem cell","Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Computational Biology; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Networks; Germ Cells; Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Male; Mice; RNA; RNA, Circular; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Sex Factors; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; circular RNA; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 15a 5p; RNA; unclassified drug; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; RNA; transcriptome; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; cell differentiation; cell isolation; chromosomal localization; controlled study; female; gamete; gene ontology; gene targeting; germline stem cell; high throughput sequencing; male; mouse; nonhuman; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; RNA binding; RNA sequence; sequence alignment; sex difference; signal transduction; animal; biology; blood; chromosomal mapping; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; germ cell; metabolism; nucleic acid database; procedures; sequence analysis; sex factor","","RNA, 63231-63-0; Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, ; RNA, ; RNA, Circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ; RNA, Messenger, ","","","","","Kubota H., Avarbock M.R., Brinster R.L., Spermatogonial stem cells share some, but not all, phenotypic and functional characteristics with other stem cells, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 6487-6492, (2003); de Rooij D.G., Russell L.D., All you wanted to know about spermatogonia but were afraid to ask, J Androl, 21, pp. 776-798, (2000); Sakashita A., Kawabata Y., Jincho Y., Tajima S., Kumamoto S., Kobayashi H., Matsui Y., Kono T., Sex Specification and Heterogeneity of Primordial Germ Cells in Mice, PLoS One, 10, (2015); Golestaneh N., Kokkinaki M., Pant D., Jiang J., DeStefano D., Fernandez-Bueno C., Rone J.D., Haddad B.R., Gallicano G.I., Dym M., Pluripotent stem cells derived from adult human testes, Stem Cells Dev, 18, pp. 1115-1126, (2009); Vansandt L.M., Livesay J.L., Dickson M.J., Li L., Pukazhenthi B.S., Keefer C.L., Conservation of spermatogonial stem cell marker expression in undifferentiated felid spermatogonia, Theriogenology, 86, pp. 1022-1035, (2016); Xie W., Wang H., Wu J., Similar morphological and molecular signatures shared by female and male germline stem cells, Sci Rep, 4, (2014); Wu J., Zheng Z., Wang H., Mei X., Ding X., Li X., Primordial germ cells and germ line stem cells.

They are implicated in modulation of gene expression thus affecting various cellular and disease processes. Based on existing bioinformatics approaches, we developed a comprehensive workflow called Circ-Seq to identify and report expressed circRNAs. Circ-Seq also provides informative genomic annotation along circRNA fused junctions thus allowing prioritization of circRNA candidates. We applied Circ-Seq first to RNA-sequence data from breast cancer cell lines and validated one of the large circRNAs identified. Circ-Seq was then applied to a larger cohort of breast cancer samples (n = 885) provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including tumors and normal-adjacent tissue samples. Notably, circRNA results reveal that normal-adjacent tissues in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) subtype have relatively higher numbers of circRNAs than tumor samples in TCGA. Similar phenomenon of high circRNA numbers were observed in normal breastmammary tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Finally, we observed that number of circRNAs in normal-adjacent samples of ER+ subtype is inversely correlated to the risk-of-relapse proliferation (ROR-P) score for proliferating genes, suggesting that circRNA frequency may be a marker for cell proliferation in breast cancer. The Circ-Seq workflow will function for both single and multi-threaded compute environments. We believe that Circ-Seq will be a valuable tool to identify circRNAs useful in the diagnosis and treatment of other cancers and complex diseases.","Breast cancer; Circ-seq; Circular RNA; Molecular subtypes;

Identifying the association between circRNAs and diseases has important potential value for the diagnosis and treatment of complex human diseases. Although biological experiments can more accurately identify the association between circRNAs and diseases, they are usually blind and limited by small scale and high cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need for efficient and feasible computational methods to predict the potential circRNA-disease associations on a large scale, so as to provide the most promising candidate for biological experiments. In this paper, we propose a novel computational method based on the deep Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) algorithm combined with the multi-source similarity information to predict the circRNA-disease associations. Firstly, we fuse the multi-source information of disease semantic similarity, disease and circRNA Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, and then use GAN to extract the hidden features of fusion information objectively and effectively in the way of confrontation learning, and finally send them to Logistic Model Tree (LMT) classifier for accurate prediction. The 5-fold cross-validation experiment of the proposed model achieved 89.2% accuracy with 89.4% precision at the AUC of 90.6% on the CIRCR2Disease dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art SVM classifier and other feature extraction methods, the proposed model shows strong competitiveness. In addition, the predicted results of this model are supported by the biological experiments, and 9 of the top 15 circRNA-disease associations with the highest scores were confirmed by recently published literature. These promising results indicate that the proposed model is an effective tool for predicting circRNA-disease associations and can provide reliable candidates for biological experiments. © 2019 IEEE.","Biological networks;

Modifications occur in coding RNAs and noncoding-RNAs post-transcriptionally and they can influence the RNA structure, metabolism, and function. The result is the expansion of the variety of the transcriptome. In fact, depending on the type of modification, RNA molecules enter into a specific program exerting the role of the player or/and the target in biological and pathological processes. Many research groups are exploring the role of RNA modifications (alias epitranscriptome) in cell proliferation, survival, and in more specialized activities. More recently, the role of RNA modifications has been also explored in stem cell biology. Our understanding in this context is still in its infancy. Available evidence addresses the role of RNA modifications in self-renewal, commitment, and differentiation processes of stem cells. In this review, we will focus on five epitranscriptomic marks: N6-methyladenosine, N1-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, Pseudouridine (ψ) and Adenosine-to-Inosine editing. We will provide insights into the function and the distribution of these chemical modifications in coding RNAs and noncoding-RNAs. Mainly, we will emphasize the role of epitranscriptomic mechanisms in the biology of naïve, primed, embryonic, adult, and cancer stem cells. © 2018 by the authors.

In response, the expressions of ciRS-7, miR-7 and NF-κB subunit (ie RELA) within NSCLC tissues and cell lines were determined with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Moreover, the NSCLC cells were transfected with pcDNA3-ciRS-7-ir, pcDNA3-ciRS-7, miR-NC and miR-7 mimic. Furthermore, the targeted relationships between ciRS-7 and miR-7, as well as between miR-7 and RELA, were confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. The proliferation, migration and apoptosis of NSCLC cells were, successively, measured using CCK-8 assay, wound-healing assay and flow cytometry test. Consequently, ciRS-7, miR-7, histopathological grade, lymph node metastasis and histopathological stage could independently predict the prognosis of patients with NSCLC (all P <.05). Moreover, remarkably up-regulated ciRS-7 and RELA expressions, as along with down-regulated miR-7 expressions, were found within NSCLC tissues and cells in comparison with normal ones (P <.05). Besides, overexpressed ciRS-7 and underexpressed miR-7 were correlated with increased proliferation, migration and invasion, yet reduced apoptosis rate of NSCLC cells (P <.05). More than that, ciRS-7 specifically targeted miR-7 to reduce its expressions (P <.05). Ultimately, the NSCLC cells within miR-7 + RELA group were observed with superior proliferative, migratory and invasive capabilities than those within miR-7 group (P <.05), and RELA expression was also significantly modified by both ciRS-7 and miR-7 (P <.05). In conclusion, the ciRS-7/miR-7/NF-kB axis could exert pronounced impacts on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of NSCLC cells. © 2018 The Authors.

Using an adjusted P-value of <0.05 and an absolute log value of fold-change >1, 16 and 156 miRNAs from GSE30656 and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 5,321 mRNAs from GSE63514, 4,076 mRNAs from cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (from TCGA) and 75 circRNAs from GSE102686 were obtained. Using RNAhybrid, Venn and UpSetR plot, 12 circRNA-miRNA pairs and 266 miRNA-mRNA pairs were obtained. Once these pairs were combined, a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network with 11 circRNA nodes, 4 miRNA nodes, 153 mRNA nodes and 203 edges was constructed. By constructing the protein-protein interaction network using Molecular Complex Detection scores >5 and >5 nodes, 7 hubgenes (RRM2, CEP55, CHEK1, KIF23, RACGAP1, ATAD2 and KIF11) were identified. By mapping the 7 hubgenes into the preliminary circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network, a circRNA-miRNA-hubgenes network consisting of 5 circRNAs (hsa_circRNA_000596, hsa_circRNA_104315, hsa_circRNA_400068, hsa_circRNA_101958 and hsa_circRNA_103519), 2 mRNAs (hsa-miR-15b and hsa-miR-106b) and 7 mRNAs (RRM2, CEP55, CHEK1, KIF23, RACGAP1, ATAD2 and KIF11) was constructed. There were 22 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axes identified in the subnetwork. By analyzing the overall survival for the 7 hubgenes using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis tool, higher expression of RRM2 was demonstrated to be associated with a significantly poorer overall survival. PharmGkbanalysisidentifiedsinglenucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) of rs5030743 and rs1130609 of RRM2, which can be treated with cladribine and cytarabine. RRM2 was also indicated to be involved in the gemcitabine pathway. The 5 circRNAs (hsa_circRNA_000596, hsa_circRNA_104315, hsa_circRNA_400068, hsa_circRNA_101958 and hsa_ circRNA_103519) may function as competing endogenous RNAs and serve critical roles in cervical cancer. In addition, cytarabine may produce similar effects to gemcitabine and may be an optional chemotherapeutic drug for treating cervical cancer by targeting rs5030743 and rs1130609 or other similar SNPs. However, the specific mechanism of action should be confirmed by further study. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

An increasing amount of experimental evidence shows that ncRNAs are frequently dysregulated in diseases. Further, ncRNAs have been discovered in different extracellular forms, such as exosomes, which circulate in human body fluids. Thus, miRandola 2017 is an effort to update and collect the accumulating information on extracellular ncRNAs that is spread across scientific publications and different databases. Data are manually curated from 314 articles that describe miRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs. Fourteen organisms are now included in the database, and associations of ncRNAs with 25 drugs, 47 sample types and 197 diseases. miRandola also classifies extracellular RNAs based on their extracellular form: Argonaute2 protein, exosome, microvesicle, microparticle, membrane vesicle, high density lipoprotein and circulating. We also implemented a new web interface to improve the user experience. © The Author(s) 2017.

Growing evidence supports a role for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in CRC. In particular, they form competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks involved in the regulation of mRNA expression. However, the role of these networks in the pathogenesis of CRC is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA systems in CRC pathogenesis based on the construction of a ceRNA network. Methods: RNA expression profiles were obtained from public datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and used for further analysis by online databases and tools. Results: In total, 245 circRNAs, 1,666 lncRNAs, 5 miRNAs, and 934 mRNAs were differentially expressed in CRC samples. Functional enrichment analysis identified altered biological functions related to the mRNAs in the ceRNA network, and it was found that the oxytocin signaling pathway was significantly enriched (P<0.05) in genes with differential expression in CRC. Additionally, we established a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identified 10 hub genes for the construction of circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-hub gene regulatory modules. Conclusions: We identified several ncRNAs with a possible pathogenetic role in CRC and built a CRC-specific ceRNA network. The results of our study provide novel insights into the molecular events implicated in CRC. © Translational Cancer Research.

Therefore, this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of immune inhibitory molecular human endogenous retrovirus-H long terminal repeat-associating protein 2 (HHLA2) in ccRCC prognosis and transcriptional regulatory network. Methods Expression of HHLA2 in ccRCC was examined by an online database platform ONCOMINE. The ONCOMINE result was independently validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier survival was generated using IBM SPSS Statistics V.22. ccRCC tissues cells with high HHLA2 were sorted and subjected to microarray transcriptional profiling and analysis. Results It was shown that expression of HHLA2 was statistically significantly increased in ccRCC tissues compared with normal renal tissues at both transcriptional and protein level. Moreover, the expression of HHLA2 was closely correlated with multiple clinicopathological features including tumour size, clinical stage and histological grade. High HHLA2 expression was associated with poor overall survival and clinical outcome. Comprehensive microarray analysis further identified thousands of HHLA2 targets including mRNA, long non-coding RNA and circular RNA that might function in various biological processes, especially, immune response. Conclusion Increased HHLA2 expression was observed in ccRCC tumour tissue, which leads to a remarkable shorter overall survival and poorer prognosis. Together with other molecular evidence, we have demonstrated that HHLA2 could be a potential prognostic biomarker for ccRCC. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 132 patients with primary NSCLC who received surgical resection were recruited in this retrospective study. All patients' tumor tissue and paired adjacent tissue were collected for circRNA ciRS-7 expression detection by RT-qPCR. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. CCK-8 and Annexin-V/propidium iodide (AV/PI) assays were performed to detect cells proliferation and apoptosis in A549 cells after circRNA ciRS-7 inhibition plasmid transfection. RESULTS: CircRNA ciRS-7 expression in tumor tissue was elevated compared to paired adjacent tissue, and positively correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stages. K-M curves illustrated that circRNA ciRS-7 high expression was correlated with both shorter DFS and OS, and multivariate Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis showed that circRNA ciRS-7 high expression was an independent factor for predicting unfavorable DFS and OS. Cells methods revealed that circRNA ciRS-7 expression was elevated in NSCLC cell lines (A549, PC9, NCI-H1299 and NCI-H1650) compared to normal lung epithelial cells (DEAS-2B), and the inhibition of circRNA ciRS-7 expression reduced cells proliferation and promoted cells apoptosis in A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: CircRNA ciRS-7 overexpression is associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis in NSCLC patients, and the down-regulation of circRNA ciRS-7 inhibits tumor cells proliferation as well as improves cells apoptosis. © Verduci Editore s.r.l.

It is therefore highly relevant to identify if a transcript of interest can also function as a circRNA. Here, we present a user-friendly web server that predicts if coding and noncoding RNAs have circRNA isoforms and whether circRNAs are expressed in stem cells. The predictions are made by random forest models using sequence-derived features as input. The output scores are converted to fractiles, which are used to assess the circRNA and stem cell potential. The performances of the three models are reported as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and are 0.82 for coding genes, 0.89 for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 0.72 for stem cell expression. We present WebCircRNA for quick evaluation of human genes and transcripts for their circRNA potential, which can be essential in several contexts. © 2018 by the authors.

Recent evidences reveal that ncRNAs play critical roles in initiation and progression of cancers. But it is not easy for cancer biologists and medical doctors to easily know the potential roles of ncRNAs in cancer and retrieve the information of ncRNAs under their investigations. To make the available web-based resources more accessible and understandable, we made a comprehensive review for 49 web-based resources of three types of ncRNAs, i.e., microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs). We also listed some preferred resources for 6 different types of analyses related to ncRNAs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer; Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA); microRNA (miRNA); Non-coding RNA (ncRNA); Web-base resources","Databases, Genetic; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Untranslated; circular RNA; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; transcription factor; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; RNA; RNA, circular; untranslated RNA; cancer research; data base; disease association; expressed sequence tag; gene expression; genomics; high throughput sequencing; human; Internet; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; RNA sequence; Short Survey; web browser; genetic database; genetics; metabolism; neoplasm","","RNA, 63231-63-0; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ; RNA, Untranslated, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, (SKLGE-1511); State Key Laboratory of Space Medicine Fundamentals and Application, China Astronaut Research and Training Center; Fudan University; State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, China Agricultural University"," The research was supported in part by two grants (No. 31460295 and 31760314 ) of National Natural Science Foundation of China ( http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/ ) and a grant (No. SKLGE-1511 ) of the Open Research Funds of the State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Fudan University, China , to YZ.

Among the circRNAs, recent studies have brought circPVT1 under focus as the most potent oncogenic non-coding RNA. Recent studies on various aspects of circPVT1, including its biogenesis, molecular alteration and its probable role in oncogenesis, have been conducted for research and clinical interest. In this review, a first attempt has been made to summarise the available data on circPVT1 from PubMed and other relevant databases with special emphasis on its role in development, progression and prognosis of various malignant conditions. CircPVT1 is derived from the same genetic locus encoding for long non-coding RNA lncPVT1; however, existing literature suggested circPVT1 and lncPVT1 are transcripted independently by different promoters. The interaction between circRNA and microRNA has been highlighted in majority of the few malignancies in which circPVT1 was studied. Besides its importance in diagnostic and prognostic procedures, circPVT1 seemed to have huge therapeutic potential as evident from differential drug response of cancer cell line as well as primary tumors depending on expression level of the candidate. circPVT1 in cancer therapeutics might be promising as a biomarker to make the existing treatment protocol more effective and also as potential target for designing novel therapeutic intervention. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Although many circRNAs have been discovered in plants and animals, the functions of these RNAs have not been fully investigated. In addition to the function of circRNAs as microRNA (miRNA) decoys, the translation potential of circRNAs is important for the study of their functions; yet, few tools are available to identify their translation potential. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology and the emergence of ribosome profiling technology, it is possible to identify the coding ability of circRNAs with high sensitivity. To evaluate the coding ability of circRNAs, we first developed the CircCode tool and then used CircCode to investigate the translation potential of circRNAs from humans and Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on the ribosome profile databases downloaded from NCBI, we found 3,610 and 1,569 translated circRNAs in humans and A. thaliana, respectively. Finally, we tested the performance of CircCode and found a low false discovery rate and high sensitivity for identifying circRNA coding ability. CircCode, a Python 3–based framework for identifying the coding ability of circRNAs, is also a simple and powerful command line-based tool. To investigate the translation potential of circRNAs, the user can simply fill in the given configuration file and run the Python 3 scripts.

Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being associated with a disease was calculated. For the miRNAs associated with individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the enrichment of genes associated with particular biological processes. Secondly, disease associated SNPs were mapped on circRNA loci, and Argonaute (Ago) interaction sites on circular RNAs were identified. We compiled a database of disease-circRNA association in Circ2Traits (http://gyanxet-beta.com/circdb/), the first comprehensive knowledgebase of potential association of circular RNAs with diseases in human. © 2013 Ghosal, Das, Sen, Basak and Chakrabarti.","Circular RNA; Disease; Interaction network; MiRNA; SNP","","","","","","","","Bhartiya D., Jalali S., Ghosh S., Scaria V., Distinct patterns of genetic variations in potential functional elements in long noncoding RNAs, Hum.

For several decades circRNAs have been known to exist, however only recently the widespread abundance has become appreciated. Annotation of circRNAs depends on sequencing reads spanning the backsplice junction and therefore map as non-linear reads in the genome. Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA-finder, find-circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites. Collectively, this study emphasizes that circRNA annotation should be handled with care and that several algorithms should ideally be combined to achieve reliable predictions. © 2016 The Author(s) 2015.

RNA interference mediated by short interfering RNAs and microRNAs (miRNA), is a widespread anti-viral defense strategy. Importantly, viruses also encode their own miRNAs. In recent times miRNAs were identified as key players in host-virus interaction. Furthermore, viruses were shown to exploit the host miRNA networks to suite their own need. The complex cross-talk between host and viral miRNAs and their cellular and viral targets forms the environment for viral pathogenesis. Apart from protein-coding mRNAs, non-coding RNAs may also be targeted by host or viral miRNAs in virus infected cells, and viruses can exploit the host miRNA mediated gene regulatory network via the competing endogenous RNA effect. A recent report showed that viral U-rich non-coding RNAs called HSUR, expressed in primate virus herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) infected T cells, were able to bind to three host miRNAs, causing significant alteration in cellular level for one of the miRNAs. We have predicted protein coding and non protein-coding targets for viral and human miRNAs in virus infected cells. We identified viral miRNA targets within host non-coding RNA loci from AGO interacting regions in three different virus infected cells. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the genes comprising the ceRNA networks in the virus infected cells revealed enrichment of key cellular signaling pathways related to cell fate decisions and gene transcription, like Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, as well as pathways related to viral entry, replication and virulence. We identified a vast number of non-coding transcripts playing as potential ceRNAs to the immune response associated genes; e.g., APOBEC family genes, in some virus infected cells. All these information are compiled in HumanViCe (http://gyanxet-beta.com/humanvice), a comprehensive database that provides the potential ceRNA networks in virus infected human cells. © 2014 Ghosal, Das, Sen and Chakrabarti.","aPOBEC; CeRNA; CircRNA; Host-virus interaction; Immune response; lncRNA; MicroRNA; Virus","microRNA; microRNA 124; microRNA 155; Notch receptor; small interfering RNA; article; BK virus; Epstein Barr virus; gene expression; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; genetic algorithm; genetic association; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; Herpes virus; Herpes virus saimiri; Human cytomegalovirus; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; immune response; JC virus; merkel cell polyomavirus; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; RNA interference; Simian virus 40; virulence; virus cell interaction; virus entry; virus infection; virus replication; Wnt signaling pathway","GENBANK: GSE33584, GSE41357, GSE41437, GSE44332, GSE52530, NM_000967, NM_001167, NM_001644, NM_001728, NM_002727, NM_002789, NM_003118, NM_003199, NM_005514, NM_006287, NM_006789, NM_007293, NM_014508, NM_021822, NM_032991, NM_033247, NM_133376, NM_145298, NM_145699, NM_145868, NM_152426, NM_174871, NM_181773, NM_198057, NM_203454","","","","","","Bartel D.P., MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions, Cell, 136, pp. 215-233, (2009); Berkhout B., Haasnoot J., The interplay between virus infection and the cellular RNA interference machinery, FEBS Lett, 580, pp. 2896-2902, (2006); Bhartiya D., Pal K., Ghosh S., Kapoor S., Jalali S., Panwar B., Et al., lncRNome: a comprehensive knowledgebase of human long noncoding RNAs., Database (Oxford), 2013, (2013); Breuer K., Foroushani A.K., Laird M.R., Chen C., Sribnaia A., Lo R., Et al., InnateDB: systems biology of innate immunity and beyond-recent updates and continuing curation, Nucleic Acids Res., 41, (2013); Cesana M., Cacchiarelli D., Legnini I., Santini T., Sthandier O., Chinappi M., Et al., A long noncoding RNA controls muscle differentiation by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA, Cell, 147, pp. 358-369, (2011); Cheshenko N., Liu W., Satlin L.M., Herold B.C., Focal adhesion kinase plays a pivotal role in herpes simplex virus entry, J.

Among the products of SGMS1, we found new transcripts, circular RNAs (circRNAs), that contain sequences of the gene’s 50 untranslated region (50UTR). Some of them include the gene’s coding region and fragments of introns. An analysis of the abundance of circRNAs in human tissues showed that the largest transcripts were predominantly found in different parts of the brain. circRNAs of rat and mouse sphingomyelin synthase 1 orthologous genes were detected and are highly similar to the human SGMS1 gene transcripts. A quantitative analysis of the abundance of such transcripts also revealed their elevated amount in the brain. A computational analysis of sequences of human circRNAs showed their high potential of binding microRNAs (miRNAs), including the miRNAs that form complexes with Ago proteins and the mRNA of SGMS1. We assume that the circRNAs identified here participate in the regulation of the function of the SGMS1 gene in the brain. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","5’UTR; Brain-specific expression; Circular RNAs;

Here we report a homology-independent approach for discovering viroids, a distinct class of free circular RNA subviral pathogens that encode no protein and are known to infect plants only. Our approach involves analyzing the sequences of the total small RNAs of the infected plants obtained by deep sequencing with a unique computational algorithm, progressive filtering of overlapping small RNAs (PFOR). Viroid infection triggers production of viroid-derived overlapping siRNAs that cover the entire genome with high densities. PFOR retains viroid-specific siRNAs for genome assembly by progressively eliminating nonoverlapping small RNAs and those that overlap but cannot be assembled into a direct repeat RNA, which is synthesized from circular or multimeric repeated-sequence templates during viroid replication. We show that viroids from the two known families are readily identified and their full-length sequences assembled by PFOR from small RNAs sequenced from infected plants. PFOR analysis of a grapevine library further identified a viroid-like circular RNA 375 nt long that shared no significant sequence homology with known molecules and encoded active hammerhead ribozymes in RNAs of both plus and minus polarities, which presumably self-cleave to release monomer from multimeric replicative intermediates. A potential application of the homology-independent approach for viroid discovery in plant and animal species where RNA replication triggers the biogenesis of siRNAs is discussed.","","Algorithms; Computational Biology;

The rate of discovery of these subviral pathogens was low over the past 40 years because the classical approaches are technical demanding and time-consuming. We previously described an approach for homology-independent discovery of replicating circular RNAs by analysing the total small RNA populations from samples of diseased tissues with a computational program known as progressive filtering of overlapping small RNAs (PFOR). However, PFOR written in PERL language is extremely slow and is unable to discover those subviral pathogens that do not trigger in vivo accumulation of extensively overlapping small RNAs. Moreover, PFOR is yet to identify a new viroid capable of initiating independent infection. Here we report the development of PFOR2 that adopted parallel programming in the C++ language and was 3 to 8 times faster than PFOR. A new computational program was further developed and incorporated into PFOR2 to allow the identification of circular RNAs by deep sequencing of long RNAs instead of small RNAs. PFOR2 analysis of the small RNA libraries from grapevine and apple plants led to the discovery of Grapevine latent viroid (GLVd) and Apple hammerhead viroid-like RNA (AHVd-like RNA), respectively. GLVd was proposed as a new species in the genus Apscaviroid, because it contained the typical structural elements found in this group of viroids and initiated independent infection in grapevine seedlings. AHVd-like RNA encoded a biologically active hammerhead ribozyme in both polarities, and was not specifically associated with any of the viruses found in apple plants. We propose that these computational algorithms have the potential to discover novel circular RNAs in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates regardless of whether they replicate and/or induce the in vivo accumulation of small RNAs. © 2014 Zhang et al.","","Algorithms;

However, only a very small fraction of these enigmatic RNAs have been well functionally characterized. In this study, we describe deep-Base v2.0 (http://biocenter.sysu.edu.cn/deepBase/), an updated platform, to decode evolution, expression patterns and functions of diverse ncRNAs across 19 species. deepBase v2.0 has been updated to provide the most comprehensive collection of ncRNA-derived small RNAs generated from 588 sRNA-Seq datasets. Moreover, we developed a pipeline named lncSeeker to identify 176 680 high-confidence lncR-NAs from 14 species. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of various ncRNAs were profiled. We identified approximately 24 280 primate-specific, 5193 rodent-specific lncRNAs, and 55 highly conserved lncRNA orthologs between human and zebrafish. We annotated 14 867 human circRNAs, 1260 of which are orthologous to mouse circRNAs. By combining expression profiles and functional genomic annotations, we developed lncFunction webserver to predict the function of lncRNAs based on protein-lncRNA co-expression networks. This study is expected to provide considerable resources to facilitate future experimental studies and to uncover ncRNA functions. © The Author(s) 2015.","","Animals; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Evolution, Molecular; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mice; Molecular Sequence Annotation; RNA; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Small Untranslated; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Software; circular RNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; RNA; small nucleolar RNA; small RNA; unclassified drug; long untranslated RNA; RNA; RNA, circular; small untranslated RNA; Article; client server application; computer interface; computer program; conservation genetics; controlled study; data base; deep sequence; evolutionary homology; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene function; gene identification; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; human; molecular genetics; mouse; nonhuman; open reading frame; prediction; priority journal; protein domain; RNA sequence; zebra fish; animal; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; molecular evolution; nucleic acid database; physiology; sequence analysis; software","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Long Noncoding, ; RNA, Small Untranslated, ","deepBase v2.0","","Science and Technology New Star in ZhuJiang Guangzhou city, (2012J2200025); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (30900820, 31230042, 31370791, 31401975, 31471223, 91440110); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (200902348); Government of Guangdong Province, (S2012010010510, S2013010012457); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2011CB811300); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (14lgjc18, 2011330003161070); Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Computational Science, GPK-LCS","Ministry of Science and Technology of China, National Basic Research Program [2011CB811300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30900820, 31230042, 31370791, 31401975, 31471223, 91440110]; Guangdong Province [S2012010010510, S2013010012457]; The project of Science and Technology New Star in ZhuJiang Guangzhou city [2012J2200025]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2011330003161070, 14lgjc18]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [200902348]; This research is supported in part by the Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Computational Science and the Guangdong Province Computational Science Innovative Research Team.

CircRNAs are distinct from their linear counterparts because they lack the 5′ caps and 3′ tails that typically help determine the cellular fate of a transcript. However, due to the lack of free ends, circRNAs are impervious to exonucleases and thus can evade normal RNA turnover mechanisms. Most circRNAs are derived from protein-coding pre-mRNAs, via a mechanism called ""back-splicing."" Existing methods of circRNA expression thus typically involve genes that have been engineered to contain sequence elements that promote back-splicing. We recently uncovered an anciently conserved mechanism of RNA circularization in metazoans that involves splicing of tRNA introns. This splicing mechanism is completely independent from that of pre-mRNAs. In this chapter, we detail an orthogonal method that involves splicing of intron-containing tRNAs in order to produce circRNAs in vivo. We utilize fluorescence-based RNA reporters to characterize the expression, localization, and stability of these so-called tRNA intronic circular RNAs. Because tRNA biogenesis is essential for all cellular life, this method provides a means to express ultrastable, high-copy, circRNA effectors in a wide variety of metazoan cell types. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

So it is very promising to identify circularRNA transcripts from de novo assembled transcripts obtained by high-throughput sequencing, such as RNA-seq data. In this study, we presented a machine learning approach, named as PredcircRNA, focused on distinguishing circularRNA from other lncRNAs using multiple kernel learning. Firstly we extracted different sources of discriminative features, including graph features, conservation information and sequence compositions, ALU and tandem repeats, SNP densities and open reading frames (ORFs) from transcripts. Secondly, to better integrate features from different sources, we proposed a computational approach based on a multiple kernel learning framework to fuse those heterogeneous features. Our preliminary 5-fold cross-validation result showed that our proposed method can classify circularRNA from other types of lncRNAs with an accuracy of 0.778, sensitivity of 0.781, specificity of 0.770, precision of 0.784 and MCC of 0.554 in our constructed gold-standard dataset, respectively. Our feature importance analysis based on Random Forest illustrated some discriminative features, such as conservation features and a GTAG sequence motif.

The alteration of any of these factors may lead to ceRNA network imbalance and thus contribute to cancer initiation and progression. There are generally three steps in ceRNA research conductions: ceRNA prediction, ceRNA validation, and ceRNA functional investigation. Deciphering ceRNA interplay in cancer provides new insight into cancer pathogenesis and opportunities for therapy exploration. In this review, we try to give readers a concise and reliable illustration on the mechanism, functions, research approaches, and perspective of ceRNA in cancer. © 2015, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).","Cancer; ceRNA; miRNA; miRNA response elements","Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Untranslated; RNA-Binding Proteins; circular RNA; competing endogenous RNA; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; RNA; RNA binding protein; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; RNA; RNA binding protein; RNA, circular; untranslated RNA; binding affinity; breast cancer; carcinogenesis; cellular distribution; endometrium cancer; gene expression; gene function; human; liver cancer; lung cancer; neoplasm; nonhuman; overall survival; pathogenesis; priority journal; progression free survival; prostate cancer; protein function; protein secondary structure; pseudogene; Review; RNA editing; stomach cancer; tumor growth; gene regulatory network; genetics; neoplasm; pathology","","RNA, 63231-63-0; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, ; RNA, circular, ; RNA, Messenger, ; RNA, Untranslated, ; RNA-Binding Proteins, ","","","","","ENCODE Project, Consortium.

Genome sequencing has led to methods for investigation of the transcriptome (all expressed RNA species) using microarrays and next-generation sequencing, and implementation of these techniques has identified many novel species of RNA including: micro-RNA, long noncoding RNA, and circular RNA. These species can physically interact with both each other and regulatory proteins to modify gene expression and messenger RNA to protein translation. Transcriptome analysis is actively used to investigate placental development and dysfunction in pathologies ranging from preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction to preterm labor. Genome-wide gene expression analysis is also being applied to identify prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of these disorders. In this comprehensive review we summarize transcriptome biology, methods of isolation and analysis, application to placental development and pathology, and use in diagnostic analysis in maternal blood. Key information for analysis methods is organized into quick reference tables where current analysis techniques and tools are cited and compared. We have created this review as a practical guide and starting reference for those interested in beginning an investigation into the transcriptome of the placenta.","microarray; next-generation sequencing;
